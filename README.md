## Motivation

TBD

## Overview

This series consists of approximately 18 2-hours meetings, structured around a nucleus of topics and organized in subseries.
Each subseries is largely independent, though as the series goes on we will try to adapt the content to what has been explored during previous meetings.

It is not a formal series of lectures, therefore there are no lecture notes (yet), but we will rather try to build together a series of cheatsheets that summarize the tools explored together.
In between meetings, the Lab will reserve some 20 mins-slots to help answer questions, solve technical issues or go over specific topics and decide if they can be of interest for a future meeting.

It's mostly about **doing** rather than **knowing how to do**!

## Tools to install (updated during the series)

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/): any editor/IDE works, in fact. This is just a way to be all on the same page and be helpful to each other. Why VSCode? It can be used as a simple text/source code editor, but it can be as well plugged-in to be used as a full-fledged developing toolkit. It works cross-platform and provides support for many programming languages.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/): again we could use many versioning softwares to get the idea, but git is the de facto standard and 99% of the software out there is developed with Git.
- [Bash - Bourne Again SHell](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/): it is the default for Linux-based systems, it has to be set as default on MacOS (still UNIX, [how to do it](https://medium.com/@alvyynm/how-to-change-your-default-shell-from-zsh-to-bash-on-mac-0bbd481b4a8d)). On Windows things are a little more complicated, you can install [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) and we'll see from there.
- [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
