## Motivation

TBD

## Overview

This series consists of approximately 18 2-hours meetings, structured around a nucleus of topics and organized in subseries.
Each subseries is largely independent, though as the series goes on we will try to adapt the content to what has been explored during previous meetings.

It is not a formal series of lectures, therefore there are no lecture notes (yet), but we will rather try to build together a series of cheatsheets that summarize the tools explored together.
In between meetings, the Lab will reserve some 20 mins-slots to help answer questions, solve technical issues or go over specific topics and decide if they can be of interest for a future meeting.

It's mostly about **doing** rather than **knowing how to do**!
