## Version Control Systems
1. need to save disk space: __patch-based VCS__ (e.g. RCS)
3. need for collaborative development: __centralized VCSs__ (e.g. SVN)
4. need to work offline and prevent the server from being the "single point of failure": __distributed VCSs__ (e.g. Git, the current _de facto_ standard)

## Behind Git

## Git: basic concepts
![](xkcd.png)

- (named) filesystem snapshots rather than patches
- version history as a directed graph
- distributed, supports easy branching
- several interfaces and "hubs"

## Hands-on Git tutorial
1. local usage (simple versioning)
2. setting up a remote GitHub repository \newline (versioning + backup)
3. collaborative usage with GitHub
