## Today's session
1. Variations on the theme of Alice (bash exercises)
2. Intro to version control and Git
3. Hands-on Git tutorial

## What you will need
- a Unix-like shell 
- the basic Git CLI program
- a GitHub account

## Alice in Unixland
```bash
cat alice.txt | tr " " "\n" | sort 
| uniq -c | sort -nr | head -n10
```

## Exercises
Modify the text processing command so to:

- show the _20_ most frequent words
- show the 20 _least_ frequent words
- show all words and their counts _in alphabetical order_
- write the results to a new text file
- show the 10 most frequent words, _excluding punctuation_
- show all words _whose frequency is exactly 1_
- ...

## Manual versioning

## Version Control Systems
1. need to save disk space: __patch-based VCS__ (e.g. RCS)
3. need for collaborative development: __centralized VCSs__ (e.g. SVN)
4. need to work offline and prevent the server from being the "single point of failure": __distributed VCSs__ (e.g. Git, the current _de facto_ standard)

## Behind Git

## Git: basic concepts
![](xkcd.png)

- (named) filesystem snapshots rather than patches
- version history as a directed graph
- distributed, supports easy branching
- several interfaces and "hubs"

## Hands-on Git tutorial
1. local usage (simple versioning)
2. setting up a remote GitHub repository \newline (versioning + backup)
3. collaborative usage with GitHub
