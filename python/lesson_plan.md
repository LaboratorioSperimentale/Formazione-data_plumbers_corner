# Introducing Python


## What is Python?

- Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language
- It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991
- It is widely used in academia, industry, and research
- It is known for its readability and simplicity
- It is open-source and has a large community of users and developers


## Why Python?

- Python is a versatile language that can be used for many different tasks
- It is easy to learn and use
- It has a large standard library and many third-party packages
- It is cross-platform and runs on all major operating systems
- It is widely used in scientific computing, data analysis, machine learning, web development, and more


## How to use Python

- Python can be run interactively in a REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) or in scripts
- The Python interpreter can be started by typing `python` in the terminal
- Python scripts are text files with the `.py` extension that contain Python code
- Python code can be executed by running the script with the Python interpreter (`python script.py`) or by making the script executable and running it directly (`./script.py`)


## Basic Python syntax

- data types:
   - integers: `42`
   - floats: `3.14`
   - strings: `"Hello, world!"`
   - booleans: `True`, `False`
   - lists: `[1, 2, 3]`

- type conversions:
   - `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, `bool()`

- statements:
   - variable assignment: `x = 42`
   - conditional: `if x == 42:`
   - loop: `for i in range(10):`

- expressions:
   - arithmetic: `x + 1`
   - comparison: `x == 42`
   - logical: `x > 0 and x < 100`

### Hands-on part

- using the Python REPL
   - basic arithmetic
   - variables and assignments
   - type conversions

- writing and running Python scripts
   - simple programs
   - use if and for statements


## Python for text processing

- data strucutres
   - list: `[1, 2, 3]`
   - map: `{"foo": 4, "bar": 7}`

- string manipulation
   - `split()`, `trim()`, `join()`, `replace()`

- open and reads files
   - `open()`, `f.readlines()`


### Exercises

- write a Python script that reads a text file and counts the number of words in it
- write a Python script that reads a text file and prints the most common word in it
- write a Python script that reads a text file and prints the 10 most common words in it
- write a Python script that reads a text file and plots the frequency of the words
