1
00:01:30,555 --> 00:01:32,978
Charles, you have finally
lost your senses

2
00:01:32,978 --> 00:01:35,609
This venture is impossible.

3
00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:36,445
For some.

4
00:01:36,445 --> 00:01:40,329
Gentlemen, the only way to achieve the
impossible is to think that it is possible.

5
00:01:40,371 --> 00:01:42,334
That kind of thinking could ruin you

6
00:01:42,334 --> 00:01:44,130
I'm willing to take that chance.

7
00:01:44,172 --> 00:01:49,602
Imagine a trading post
in Rangoon! Bangkok, Jakarta!

8
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,369
The nightmare again?

9
00:02:01,673 --> 00:02:03,303
I won't be long

10
00:02:04,639 --> 00:02:05,893
I'm falling

11
00:02:05,893 --> 00:02:08,649
Down a dark hole.

12
00:02:08,649 --> 00:02:12,575
Then I see strange creatures.

13
00:02:12,575 --> 00:02:14,956
What kind of creatures?

14
00:02:14,956 --> 00:02:19,383
There's a dodo bird,
a rabbit in a waist coat

15
00:02:19,383 --> 00:02:21,555
and a smiling cat

16
00:02:21,555 --> 00:02:24,062
I did not know cats could smile.

17
00:02:24,062 --> 00:02:26,067
Neither did I.

18
00:02:26,067 --> 00:02:29,784
And there is a blue caterpillar.

19
00:02:29,784 --> 00:02:32,165
A blue caterpillar?

20
00:02:35,172 --> 00:02:37,887
Do you think I've gone round the bend?

21
00:02:42,482 --> 00:02:44,320
I'm afraid so.

22
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:48,330
You're mad, bonkers, off your head

23
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,711
But I'll tell you a secret.

24
00:02:50,711 --> 00:02:53,467
All the best people are.

25
00:02:53,467 --> 00:02:57,352
It's only a dream, Alice,
nothing can harm you there.

26
00:02:57,352 --> 00:03:00,526
But if you get too frightened,
You can always wake up.

27
00:03:00,526 --> 00:03:02,239
Like this

28
00:03:22,623 --> 00:03:24,043
Must we go?

29
00:03:25,421 --> 00:03:27,885
I doubt he'll notice
if we never arrive

30
00:03:27,885 --> 00:03:29,515
He will notice

31
00:03:32,397 --> 00:03:34,067
Where 's your corset?

32
00:03:39,832 --> 00:03:42,588
- And no stockings.
- I'm against them.

33
00:03:42,588 --> 00:03:44,552
But you are not properly dressed

34
00:03:44,552 --> 00:03:46,974
Who is to say what is "proper"?

35
00:03:46,974 --> 00:03:51,109
What if it was agreed that "proper"was wearing
a codfish on your head, would you wear it?

36
00:03:51,109 --> 00:03:52,404
Alice ...

37
00:03:52,404 --> 00:03:55,286
For me, a corset is like a codfish

38
00:03:55,327 --> 00:03:56,999
Please, not today.

39
00:03:56,999 --> 00:03:59,589
Father would have laughed.

40
00:04:01,761 --> 00:04:02,846
I'm sorry.

41
00:04:04,016 --> 00:04:07,191
I'm tired.
I didn't sleep well last night.

42
00:04:07,191 --> 00:04:09,362
Did you have bad dreams again?

43
00:04:09,362 --> 00:04:11,116
Only one.

44
00:04:11,116 --> 00:04:14,876
It's always the same, ever since I can remember

45
00:04:14,876 --> 00:04:17,048
Do you think that's normal?

46
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:19,930
Don't most people have different dreams?

47
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:22,311
I don't know.

48
00:04:30,957 --> 00:04:32,252
There.

49
00:04:32,252 --> 00:04:34,591
You're beautiful.

50
00:04:34,591 --> 00:04:36,930
Now, can you mange to smile?

51
00:04:53,262 --> 00:04:55,894
At last.
We thought you'd never arrive

52
00:04:55,894 --> 00:04:58,984
Alice, Hamish is waiting to dance with you .

53
00:04:58,984 --> 00:05:00,488
Go.

54
00:05:03,997 --> 00:05:06,127
You do realize it's well past 4??

55
00:05:06,127 --> 00:05:08,132
Now everything I've been rushed through

56
00:05:08,132 --> 00:05:10,554
- I'm sorry.
- Nevermind.

57
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:18,198
Forgive my wife. She been planning
this affair for over 20 years.

58
00:05:20,036 --> 00:05:21,874
If only Charles were here.

59
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,506
My condolences

60
00:05:24,506 --> 00:05:26,886
I think off your husband often.

61
00:05:26,886 --> 00:05:29,267
He was truly a man of vision

62
00:05:30,855 --> 00:05:34,363
I hope you do not think I've taken
advantage of your misfortunes

63
00:05:34,363 --> 00:05:35,783
Of course not.

64
00:05:35,783 --> 00:05:38,038
I'm pleased that you've purchased the company.

65
00:05:39,292 --> 00:05:43,093
I was a fool for not investing in his mad venture
when I had the chance

66
00:05:44,095 --> 00:05:46,142
Charles thought the same too

67
00:06:05,356 --> 00:06:07,987
Hamish, do you ever get tired of quadrille?

68
00:06:07,987 --> 00:06:10,744
On the contrary.
I find it envigorating

69
00:06:17,134 --> 00:06:18,471
Do I amuse you?

70
00:06:18,471 --> 00:06:19,808
No.

71
00:06:19,808 --> 00:06:24,444
I had a sudden vision. Off all the ladies
in trousers and the men wearing dresses

72
00:06:24,444 --> 00:06:27,451
It would be best to keep your visons to yourself.

73
00:06:27,451 --> 00:06:30,293
When in doubt, remain silent.

74
00:06:38,896 --> 00:06:41,737
Pardon us, sir.
Ms. Kingsley is distracted today.

75
00:06:41,737 --> 00:06:46,123
- Where is your head?
- I was wondering what it would be like to fly.

76
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,882
Why would spend your time thinking About
such an impossible thing?

77
00:06:49,882 --> 00:06:51,302
Why wouldn't I?

78
00:06:51,302 --> 00:06:54,936
My father said he sometimes believed
in six impossible things

79
00:06:54,936 --> 00:06:56,857
before breakfast.

80
00:07:03,081 --> 00:07:06,089
Alice, meet me at the Gazebo
in precisely ten minutes.

81
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,432
We have a secret to tell you.

82
00:07:10,432 --> 00:07:12,688
If you're telling me,
then it's not much of a secret

83
00:07:12,688 --> 00:07:14,567
- Perhaps we shouldn't.
- We've decided we should.

84
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:17,199
- If you tell us, we won't be surprised.
- Will you be surprised?

85
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,912
Not if you tell me

86
00:07:18,912 --> 00:07:21,042
But now you've brought it up,
you have to

87
00:07:21,042 --> 00:07:23,506
- No, we don't
- In fact, we won't

88
00:07:25,428 --> 00:07:28,894
I wonder if your mother knows that
you two swim naked into Havershim pond.

89
00:07:30,148 --> 00:07:32,153
- You wouldn't.
- Oh, but I would

90
00:07:32,153 --> 00:07:34,616
There's your mother right now

91
00:07:34,616 --> 00:07:37,123
Hamish is going to ask for your hand.

92
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,755
You've ruined the surprise.

93
00:07:41,175 --> 00:07:42,720
Oh, I could strangle them!

94
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,686
Everyone of us went through so much trouble
to keep it a secret

95
00:07:45,686 --> 00:07:47,775
Does everyone know?

96
00:07:47,775 --> 00:07:51,826
That's why they have all come.
This is your engagement party.

97
00:07:51,826 --> 00:07:54,123
Hamish will ask you under the gazebo

98
00:07:54,123 --> 00:07:56,087
When you say "yes" ...

99
00:07:56,087 --> 00:07:58,425
But I don't know if I want to marry Hamish.

100
00:07:58,425 --> 00:08:01,725
Who then?
You won't do better than a lord.

101
00:08:04,983 --> 00:08:08,742
You'll soon be 20, Alice.
That pretty face won't last forever.

102
00:08:09,954 --> 00:08:12,334
You don't want to end up like aunt Imogen.

103
00:08:13,212 --> 00:08:15,384
You don't want to be a burden
for mother, do you?

104
00:08:15,384 --> 00:08:16,428
No.

105
00:08:16,428 --> 00:08:18,934
So, you'll marry Hamish.

106
00:08:18,934 --> 00:08:22,484
You'll be as happy as I am with
Lowell and you live will be perfect

107
00:08:22,484 --> 00:08:24,197
It's already decided.

108
00:08:24,197 --> 00:08:25,826
Alice, dear

109
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:28,876
I'll leave you to it.

110
00:08:28,876 --> 00:08:33,219
Shall we take a leisurely stroll through
the garden, just you and me ?

111
00:08:38,064 --> 00:08:39,903
Do you know what I've always dreaded?

112
00:08:39,903 --> 00:08:42,116
The decline of teh artistocracy ?

113
00:08:42,116 --> 00:08:44,205
Ugly grandchildren.

114
00:08:44,205 --> 00:08:45,875
But you are lovely.

115
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:48,925
You are bound to produce little...
Imbeciles!

116
00:08:48,925 --> 00:08:52,683
The gardeners planted white roses
when i specifically asked for red.

117
00:08:52,683 --> 00:08:55,273
You could always paint the roses red

118
00:08:55,273 --> 00:08:57,445
What an odd thing to say

119
00:08:57,445 --> 00:09:01,873
You should know that my son
has extremely delicate digestion.

120
00:09:04,212 --> 00:09:06,342
- Did you see that?
- See what?

121
00:09:06,342 --> 00:09:09,267
- It was a rabbit, I think
- Nasty things

122
00:09:09,267 --> 00:09:11,897
I'd enjoy setting the dogs on them

123
00:09:11,897 --> 00:09:16,450
If you serve Hamish the wrong foods,
he could get a blockage.

124
00:09:17,537 --> 00:09:19,750
- Did you see it that time?
- See what?

125
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,547
- The rabbit!
- Don't shout!

126
00:09:21,547 --> 00:09:23,551
Now pay attention.

127
00:09:23,551 --> 00:09:26,224
Hamish said you were easily distracted.

128
00:09:26,224 --> 00:09:27,770
What was I saying?

129
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:30,193
Hamish was a blockage.

130
00:09:30,193 --> 00:09:33,869
I couldn't be more interested,
but you'll have to excuse me

131
00:09:39,841 --> 00:09:41,345
Aunt Imogen!

132
00:09:41,345 --> 00:09:44,101
I think I'm going mad.

133
00:09:44,101 --> 00:09:46,943
I keep seeing a rabbit in a waist coat

134
00:09:46,943 --> 00:09:49,991
I can't be bothered with you fancy rabbit now

135
00:09:49,991 --> 00:09:52,373
I'm waiting for my fiancee.

136
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:55,087
Your have a fiancee?

137
00:09:58,805 --> 00:10:00,517
There! Did you see it?

138
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:02,397
He's a prince.

139
00:10:02,397 --> 00:10:07,577
But alas he can not marry me
unless he renounces his throne.

140
00:10:07,577 --> 00:10:10,750
- It's tragic, isn't it?
- Very.

141
00:10:21,152 --> 00:10:22,739
Lowell?

142
00:10:23,992 --> 00:10:25,787
Alice! We were just ...

143
00:10:26,624 --> 00:10:28,210
Kathy is an old friend.

144
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,716
I can see you are very close.

145
00:10:30,716 --> 00:10:33,515
You won't mention this to your sister,
will you?

146
00:10:33,515 --> 00:10:34,894
I don't know.

147
00:10:34,894 --> 00:10:38,026
I'm confused.
I need time to think

148
00:10:38,026 --> 00:10:39,656
Well, think About Margaret.

149
00:10:39,656 --> 00:10:41,953
She'd never trust me again

150
00:10:41,953 --> 00:10:45,127
- You don't want to ruin her marriage, do you?
- Me?

151
00:10:45,127 --> 00:10:50,223
But I'm not the one who is sneaking around her back...

152
00:10:50,223 --> 00:10:52,019
Here you are.

153
00:11:04,758 --> 00:11:08,100
- Alice Kingsley ...
- Hamish.

154
00:11:09,103 --> 00:11:11,943
- What is it?
- You have a caterpillar on his shoulder.

155
00:11:15,368 --> 00:11:17,415
Ughh!

156
00:11:22,635 --> 00:11:24,349
You'll want to wash that finger.

157
00:11:29,779 --> 00:11:32,368
Alice Kingsley ...

158
00:11:36,044 --> 00:11:38,634
Will you be my wife?

159
00:11:41,933 --> 00:11:43,354
Well ...

160
00:11:45,567 --> 00:11:47,948
Everyone expects me to

161
00:11:47,948 --> 00:11:51,164
And, you are a Lord.

162
00:11:51,164 --> 00:11:56,009
My fast won't last and
I don't want to end up like..

163
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:02,400
But this is happening so quickly, I...

164
00:12:13,803 --> 00:12:17,855
I think I ...
I need a moment.

165
00:12:56,533 --> 00:12:58,163
Hi!

166
00:15:53,427 --> 00:15:55,640
DRINK ME

167
00:16:01,488 --> 00:16:03,367
It's only a dream.

168
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:49,147
You'd say she'd remember all
this from the first time.

169
00:16:50,817 --> 00:16:53,407
You have brought the wrong Alice.

170
00:16:53,407 --> 00:16:56,122
She is the right one.
I'm certain off it.

171
00:17:09,739 --> 00:17:11,577
EAT ME

172
00:17:42,612 --> 00:17:46,370
- She´s the wrong Alice!
- Give her a chance.

173
00:19:03,644 --> 00:19:06,275
Curious and curiouser

174
00:19:11,997 --> 00:19:13,627
I told you she´s the right Alice

175
00:19:13,627 --> 00:19:16,426
- I am not convinced.
- How is that for gratitude?

176
00:19:16,426 --> 00:19:20,184
I was out there for weeks,
trailing one Alice after the next

177
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:22,691
I was almost eaten
by other animals.

178
00:19:22,691 --> 00:19:25,907
Can you imagine ...
They go About entirely unclothed

179
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:28,873
And they do there shukm in public,
I had to avert my eyes

180
00:19:28,873 --> 00:19:31,504
-You do not look anything like us Alice!

181
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:34,261
That´s because she the wrong Alice!

182
00:19:34,261 --> 00:19:36,893
- If she was, she might be.
- But if she isn´t, she ain´t

183
00:19:36,893 --> 00:19:39,566
- But if she was so, she would be.
- But she isn´t, No how!

184
00:19:39,566 --> 00:19:42,823
How can I be the wrong Alice
when this is my dream?

185
00:19:44,328 --> 00:19:46,123
And who are you if i might ask?

186
00:19:46,123 --> 00:19:47,753
Oh, I am Tweedlee and he's Tweedledum.

187
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:50,092
Come cherry wise,
I am Tweedledum and he is Teweedlee.

188
00:19:50,092 --> 00:19:52,515
- We should consult Absolum.
- Exactly!

189
00:19:52,515 --> 00:19:55,230
- Absolem will know who she is.
- Alice, come on dear.

190
00:19:55,271 --> 00:19:59,740
- It´s not being your turn, it´s so unfair, leave off her!
- Let go!

191
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,122
- Are they always this way?
- It's a family trade.

192
00:20:02,122 --> 00:20:04,669
You can a both escort her

193
00:20:12,772 --> 00:20:15,905
- Who is this Absolem?
- He´s wise. He´s Absolute ...

194
00:20:15,905 --> 00:20:16,907
He´s Absolute!

195
00:20:41,969 --> 00:20:43,556
Who are you?

196
00:20:44,433 --> 00:20:47,816
- Absolem!
- You´re not Absolem. I'm Absolem.

197
00:20:47,816 --> 00:20:52,829
The question is ...
Who are you?

198
00:20:52,829 --> 00:20:56,087
- Alice.
- We shall see.

199
00:20:56,087 --> 00:20:59,428
What do you mean by that?
I ought to know who i am

200
00:20:59,428 --> 00:21:02,562
Yes, you ought. Stupid girl!

201
00:21:02,562 --> 00:21:06,070
Unroll The Oraculum.

202
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:16,345
The Oraculum, being the
calendrical compemdium of Underland

203
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:22,360
- It´s a calender.
- Compendium.

204
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:27,999
It tells of each and every day
since the beginning

205
00:21:27,999 --> 00:21:32,594
Today is Gribling day,
in the time of the Red Queen

206
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:38,191
Show her the FrAbjous Day.

207
00:21:38,191 --> 00:21:41,699
Yes, FrAbjous, being the day you´ll
slay the JAbberwocky

208
00:21:41,699 --> 00:21:45,124
Sorry?
Slay the what?

209
00:21:45,124 --> 00:21:48,090
That being you there with the
Vorpal sword.

210
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:50,763
No other swords can kill
JAbberwocky's. No how.

211
00:21:50,763 --> 00:21:53,353
If it ain´t Vorpal, it ain´t dead

212
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:57,070
- That´s not me.
- I know!

213
00:21:57,070 --> 00:22:01,498
Resolve this for us, Absolem.
Is she the right Alice?

214
00:22:01,498 --> 00:22:04,505
Not hardly.

215
00:22:07,596 --> 00:22:09,267
I told ya!

216
00:22:09,267 --> 00:22:11,815
- I said so
- I said so

217
00:22:11,815 --> 00:22:13,611
Contrary wise,
you said she might be.

218
00:22:13,611 --> 00:22:15,908
No, you said she would be if
she was.

219
00:22:15,908 --> 00:22:19,709
Little Impostor! Pretending to be Alice!
She should be ashamed!

220
00:22:19,709 --> 00:22:24,095
- I was so certain of you.
- I´m sorry, I don´t mean to be the wrong Alice!

221
00:22:25,641 --> 00:22:26,727
Wait.

222
00:22:26,727 --> 00:22:29,232
This is my dream.

223
00:22:29,232 --> 00:22:32,073
I am going to wake up now and
you will all disappear.

224
00:22:40,552 --> 00:22:43,894
That´s odd
Pinching usually does the trick

225
00:22:43,894 --> 00:22:47,528
- I could stick you if that would help?
- It might actually, thank you.

226
00:22:47,528 --> 00:22:49,198
My pleasure!

227
00:22:54,503 --> 00:22:56,258
Bandersnatch!

228
00:23:46,423 --> 00:23:47,717
Wait.

229
00:23:50,391 --> 00:23:51,978
It is only a dream.

230
00:23:51,978 --> 00:23:54,024
Nothing could hurt me.

231
00:23:58,243 --> 00:24:01,334
- What is she doing?
- He can´t hurt me, he can´t hurt me ...

232
00:24:07,975 --> 00:24:09,855
Run, you great love!

233
00:25:06,913 --> 00:25:10,170
SNUD and QUEAST

234
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:16,268
- This way!
- East to QUEAST.

235
00:25:16,268 --> 00:25:18,232
No! South to SNUD!

236
00:26:07,353 --> 00:26:10,653
Someone has stolen three of my tarts!

237
00:26:19,006 --> 00:26:20,885
- Did You steal them?
- No, Your Majesty.

238
00:26:21,888 --> 00:26:23,433
- Did You?
- No, Your Majesty.

239
00:26:23,433 --> 00:26:25,731
- Did You steal them?
- No, Your Majesty.

240
00:26:59,188 --> 00:27:03,491
- Did you steal my tart?
- No, Your Majesty ...

241
00:27:10,633 --> 00:27:12,346
It´s cranberry juice.

242
00:27:12,346 --> 00:27:15,436
- I was so hungry! I did not mean to ...
- Off with his head!

243
00:27:15,436 --> 00:27:19,613
My family! No, please, please don´t!
I have little ones to look after!

244
00:27:19,613 --> 00:27:21,201
Go to his house
and collect the little ones.

245
00:27:21,201 --> 00:27:23,999
I like frog eggs on toast almost
as much as I like caviar.

246
00:27:23,999 --> 00:27:25,670
Yes, your Majesty

247
00:27:29,053 --> 00:27:30,098
Drink.

248
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:37,157
Majesty.

249
00:27:39,579 --> 00:27:42,837
Ilosovic Stayne

250
00:27:42,837 --> 00:27:45,218
Where have you been lurking?

251
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:52,444
Majesty ...
I have found the Oraculum

252
00:27:54,199 --> 00:27:57,247
That? Looks so ordinary
for an Oraculum.

253
00:27:57,247 --> 00:28:00,547
Look here. FrAbjous Day.

254
00:28:03,054 --> 00:28:05,684
I´d know that tangled mess of hair anywhere.

255
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:07,816
Is it Alice?

256
00:28:07,816 --> 00:28:10,404
I believe it is.

257
00:28:10,404 --> 00:28:13,078
What is she doing with my darling JAbberwocky?

258
00:28:13,078 --> 00:28:15,626
She appears to be slating it

259
00:28:15,626 --> 00:28:18,216
She killed my JAbberbAbywocky?

260
00:28:18,216 --> 00:28:23,228
Not yet. But it will happen
if we don´t stop her.

261
00:28:23,228 --> 00:28:26,611
Find Alice, Stayne.
Find her!

262
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:32,375
Find the scent of human girl
and earn your freedom.

263
00:28:32,375 --> 00:28:35,007
For my wife and pups as well?

264
00:28:36,595 --> 00:28:38,892
Everyone will go home.

265
00:28:52,174 --> 00:28:55,599
Dogs will believe anything.

266
00:29:28,179 --> 00:29:32,481
I looks like you ran afoul of
something with wicked claws

267
00:29:33,358 --> 00:29:36,700
- I must be still dreaming ...
- What did that to you?

268
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:40,125
- A "bender" or "bandips" ...
- A Bandersnatch?

269
00:29:40,125 --> 00:29:44,845
- Well, I´d better have a look.
- What are you doing?

270
00:29:44,845 --> 00:29:48,813
It needs to by purified by someone
with evaporating skills

271
00:29:48,813 --> 00:29:52,364
or it will fester and putrify

272
00:29:52,364 --> 00:29:56,457
I´d rather you didn´t.
I´ll be fine as soon as I wake up.

273
00:29:56,457 --> 00:29:59,799
At least let me bind it for you

274
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:04,602
- What do you call yourself?
- Alice.

275
00:30:04,602 --> 00:30:06,899
THE Alice?

276
00:30:06,899 --> 00:30:09,406
There has been some debate About that

277
00:30:09,406 --> 00:30:11,996
I never get involved in politics.

278
00:30:11,996 --> 00:30:14,669
You´d best be on your way.

279
00:30:14,669 --> 00:30:18,679
What way? All I want to do
is wake from this dream.

280
00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:25,028
Fine. I´ll take you to the Hare
and the Hatter, but that´s the end of it

281
00:30:33,883 --> 00:30:35,261
Coming.

282
00:31:25,761 --> 00:31:27,598
Watch what you´re doing!

283
00:31:33,111 --> 00:31:34,406
It´s you!

284
00:31:34,406 --> 00:31:37,915
No it´s not.
The Twisp brought us the wrong Alice

285
00:31:37,915 --> 00:31:41,215
- Its the wrong Alice?
- It's Absolutely Alice.

286
00:31:41,215 --> 00:31:44,264
You're Absolutely Alice.
I´d know you anywhere.

287
00:31:44,264 --> 00:31:46,436
I´d know him anywhere!

288
00:31:48,817 --> 00:31:51,573
Well, as you can see,
we´re still having tea.

289
00:31:51,573 --> 00:31:55,542
And it´s all because I was obliged
to kill time waiting for your return.

290
00:31:55,542 --> 00:31:57,839
You´re terribly late, you know
Naughty!

291
00:31:59,342 --> 00:32:04,897
Well anyway, time to came quite offended
has stopped all together. Not a tick off a finger

292
00:32:06,477 --> 00:32:08,357
- Cup.
- Time can be funny in dreams.

293
00:32:08,357 --> 00:32:10,278
Yes, yes, of course,
but now you're back, you see.

294
00:32:10,278 --> 00:32:13,660
- And we need to get on to the FrAbjous Day.
- FrAbjous Day!

295
00:32:14,955 --> 00:32:17,754
I´ve been investigating things that begin with
the letter "M".

296
00:32:19,175 --> 00:32:22,642
Have you any idea why a raven is
like a writing desk?

297
00:32:22,642 --> 00:32:25,440
- "Downal wyth Bluddy Behg Hid
"!
- What?

298
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,361
"Down with the Bloody Big Head"

299
00:32:27,361 --> 00:32:29,700
Bloody Big Head, being The Red Queen

300
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,164
Come, come we simply must commit to the slaying
in such

301
00:32:32,164 --> 00:32:35,589
Therefore, is it high time to forgive and forget
or forgive and forgive

302
00:32:35,589 --> 00:32:40,059
whichever comes first, or is in any case
the most convenient, I´m waiting.

303
00:32:40,059 --> 00:32:42,524
It´s ticking, it´s ticking again

304
00:32:42,524 --> 00:32:47,118
All this talk of blood and slaying has
put me off my tea

305
00:32:49,206 --> 00:32:54,470
The entire world is falling to ruin and
poor Chester is off his tea.

306
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:59,440
What happened that day was not... my fault

307
00:33:01,028 --> 00:33:01,988
Oh, dear

308
00:33:02,364 --> 00:33:05,330
Your were out and then
to save your own skin

309
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:11,595
You gutless Scottisch pelgrim juggling
slurking urpal slackush scrum Barlemot

310
00:33:11,637 --> 00:33:12,681
Hatter!

311
00:33:13,934 --> 00:33:15,020
Thank you.

312
00:33:16,775 --> 00:33:17,735
I´m fine

313
00:33:17,735 --> 00:33:21,327
What wrong with you, Tarrant?
You used to be the light of the party.

314
00:33:21,327 --> 00:33:24,125
You used to do the best Futterwacken
in all of WitzEnd

315
00:33:24,125 --> 00:33:25,379
Futter what?

316
00:33:25,379 --> 00:33:27,718
It's a dance.

317
00:33:29,139 --> 00:33:31,644
One day, FrAbjous Day,

318
00:33:31,644 --> 00:33:34,569
when the White Queen once again
wears the crown

319
00:33:34,569 --> 00:33:41,209
On that day I shall Futterwacken ...
vigorously.

320
00:33:44,969 --> 00:33:46,054
Oh no!

321
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:52,278
- The Knave
- Goodbye.

322
00:33:54,826 --> 00:33:56,163
Drink this quickly.

323
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:04,809
Oh, dear

324
00:34:28,117 --> 00:34:29,620
Let me out!

325
00:34:33,253 --> 00:34:38,891
Well!
If it's not my favorite trio of lunatics.

326
00:34:38,934 --> 00:34:41,023
Would you like to join us?

327
00:34:42,985 --> 00:34:44,781
You´re all late for tea!

328
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:54,013
I´m looking the girl
called ... Alice.

329
00:34:54,013 --> 00:34:55,683
Speaking of the Queen,

330
00:34:55,683 --> 00:34:58,022
Here's a little song we used
to sing in her honour.

331
00:34:58,022 --> 00:35:02,492
<i> Twinkle, twinkle little red
how I wonder where you´re at</ i></i>

332
00:35:04,956 --> 00:35:08,632
If you´re hiding her,
you´ll lose your heads.

333
00:35:08,632 --> 00:35:10,427
Already lost them.

334
00:35:12,182 --> 00:35:13,352
All together noW!

335
00:35:13,352 --> 00:35:17,570
<i> Up Above the world you fly,
like a tea tray in the sky </ i></i>

336
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:22,749
<i> Twinkle, twinkle little
Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle,twinkle </ i></i>

337
00:35:30,686 --> 00:35:32,524
Don´t be bloody beggin´!

338
00:35:36,951 --> 00:35:38,371
Would you like some tea?

339
00:35:42,841 --> 00:35:45,389
Follow the blood hound

340
00:35:46,266 --> 00:35:48,188
- Sugar?
- Yes, please.

341
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:53,241
- You're all mad !
- Thanks very much.

342
00:35:56,583 --> 00:35:58,003
Pass the scones, please.

343
00:36:16,089 --> 00:36:17,509
Try this one for size.

344
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:30,541
I like it!

345
00:36:30,541 --> 00:36:33,632
Good thing the blood hound is one
of us, or you´d be...

346
00:36:34,676 --> 00:36:35,804
What do they want with me?

347
00:36:35,804 --> 00:36:39,188
Best take her to the
White Queen, she´d be safe there!

348
00:36:39,188 --> 00:36:41,485
Spoon.

349
00:36:43,156 --> 00:36:45,954
- Your carriage, m'lady.
- The Hat ?

350
00:36:45,954 --> 00:36:47,416
Of course!

351
00:36:47,416 --> 00:36:49,296
<i> Anyone can go by horse
or rail </ i></i>

352
00:36:49,296 --> 00:36:52,930
<i> But the Absolute best way to travel
is by hat </ i></i>

353
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:54,976
Have i made a rhyme?

354
00:36:55,978 --> 00:36:59,069
I love travelling by hat!

355
00:36:59,069 --> 00:37:01,992
Mally,just Alice, please
Fairfallen all!

356
00:37:10,138 --> 00:37:14,983
<i> Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wAb </ I></i>

357
00:37:14,983 --> 00:37:19,244
<i> All mimsy were the borogoves
And the mome raths outgrAbe </ i></i>

358
00:37:19,244 --> 00:37:20,789
Sorry, what was that ?

359
00:37:22,126 --> 00:37:24,214
What was what?

360
00:37:26,428 --> 00:37:30,730
<i>The JAbberwock with eyes of flame,
jaws that bite and claws that catch </ i></i>

361
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:36,243
<i>Beware of the Jubjub bird,my son
The frumnious Bandersnatch!. </ I></i>

362
00:37:36,243 --> 00:37:39,836
<i> He took his Vorpal sword in hand </ i></i>

363
00:37:39,836 --> 00:37:42,425
<i> The Vorpal blade went snicker-snack </ i></i>

364
00:37:42,425 --> 00:37:46,270
<i> He left it dead, and with its head </ i></i>

365
00:37:47,273 --> 00:37:49,385
<i> He went galumphing back </ i></i>

366
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:52,910
It's all About you, you know

367
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:57,462
I'm not slaying anything , I don't slay,
so put it out of you mind!

368
00:38:02,684 --> 00:38:03,895
Mind?

369
00:38:10,912 --> 00:38:13,126
Wait! you can't leave me here!

370
00:38:16,134 --> 00:38:17,888
You don't slay?

371
00:38:17,888 --> 00:38:21,062
Do you have any idea what
the Red Queen has done?

372
00:38:21,062 --> 00:38:23,484
You don't slay?

373
00:38:23,484 --> 00:38:25,699
I couldn't if I wanted to

374
00:38:28,413 --> 00:38:30,711
You're not the same as you were before

375
00:38:30,711 --> 00:38:36,183
You were much more, muchier
You lost your muchness

376
00:38:36,183 --> 00:38:38,104
"My muchness?

377
00:38:39,273 --> 00:38:41,821
In there, something's missing

378
00:38:41,821 --> 00:38:44,118
Tell me what Red Queen has done

379
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:49,340
It is not a pretty story.

380
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:51,261
Tell me anyway.

381
00:39:02,748 --> 00:39:04,962
It was here

382
00:39:06,089 --> 00:39:08,679
I was the Hatter to the
White Queen at the time

383
00:41:04,422 --> 00:41:06,552
Hatter ...
Hatter!

384
00:41:07,889 --> 00:41:09,100
I'm fine.

385
00:41:10,187 --> 00:41:11,732
Are you?

386
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:17,412
Did you hear that?
I'm certain I heard something.

387
00:41:18,415 --> 00:41:19,292
What?

388
00:41:20,837 --> 00:41:21,965
Red Knave

389
00:41:57,553 --> 00:42:01,103
Go south to Trottler's Bottom
The White Queen's castle is just beyond.

390
00:42:01,103 --> 00:42:03,108
Hold on tightly.

391
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,791
Done it with the Bloody Red Queen!

392
00:43:10,106 --> 00:43:12,905
You were supposed to lead them away!
The Hatter trusted you!

393
00:43:12,905 --> 00:43:15,035
They have my wife and pups

394
00:43:16,037 --> 00:43:18,000
- What is your name?
- Bayard.

395
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,880
Sit!

396
00:43:22,052 --> 00:43:24,684
Would your name be Alice,
by any chance?

397
00:43:24,684 --> 00:43:27,649
Yes, but I'm not the one that
everybody is talking About

398
00:43:27,649 --> 00:43:31,199
The Hatter would have given himself
up just for any Alice.

399
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:32,787
Where did they take him?

400
00:43:32,829 --> 00:43:35,961
To the Red Queen's Castle,
it's Salazen Grum.

401
00:43:35,961 --> 00:43:38,467
We're going to rescue him.

402
00:43:38,467 --> 00:43:39,470
That is not foretold

403
00:43:39,554 --> 00:43:41,307
I don't care!

404
00:43:41,307 --> 00:43:43,689
He wouldn't be there,
if I weren't for me

405
00:43:43,689 --> 00:43:46,529
The FrAbjous day is almost upon us.

406
00:43:46,529 --> 00:43:49,327
You must prepare to meet the JAbberwocky.

407
00:43:49,327 --> 00:43:53,629
From the moment I fell down that rabbit hole,
I have been told what I must do and who I must be.

408
00:43:53,629 --> 00:43:57,974
I've been shrunk, stretched, scratched and
stuffed into a teapot.

409
00:43:57,974 --> 00:44:02,025
I've been accused of being Alice and of
not being Alice, but this is my dream.

410
00:44:02,025 --> 00:44:04,531
I'll decide where it goes from here!

411
00:44:04,531 --> 00:44:06,828
If you diverge from the path...

412
00:44:06,828 --> 00:44:08,291
I make the path!

413
00:44:19,652 --> 00:44:23,077
Take me to Salazen Grum, Bayard,
and don´t forget the hat.

414
00:45:10,276 --> 00:45:12,406
There´s only one way across

415
00:45:18,255 --> 00:45:20,635
I´ve lost my muchness, have I?

416
00:46:04,409 --> 00:46:06,289
Bayard! Hat!

417
00:46:36,070 --> 00:46:37,658
Your Majesty.

418
00:46:45,963 --> 00:46:48,225
So Sorry

419
00:46:57,832 --> 00:46:59,504
Splendid shot!

420
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:04,014
Where's my ball?
Page!

421
00:47:04,014 --> 00:47:05,769
Yes, Your Majesty.

422
00:47:08,984 --> 00:47:10,321
I want to help you

423
00:47:15,751 --> 00:47:18,133
Well, If it isn´t the wrong Alice

424
00:47:19,469 --> 00:47:20,889
What brings you here?

425
00:47:20,889 --> 00:47:22,936
I´ve come to rescue the Hatter.

426
00:47:22,936 --> 00:47:25,400
You won´t be rescuing anyone being the
size of a jarbel.

427
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:28,283
Do you have any more of that cake
that made me grow before?

428
00:47:28,283 --> 00:47:31,415
"Upelkuchen?
Actually, i might have some left

429
00:47:41,315 --> 00:47:42,818
Not all of it!

430
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:46,535
Oh, no stop!
Oh no, don´t do that!

431
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:51,715
Oh dear,

432
00:47:57,229 --> 00:47:58,899
And what is this?

433
00:47:58,899 --> 00:48:01,197
It´s a who, Majesty.

434
00:48:01,197 --> 00:48:03,661
This is...humm...

435
00:48:04,664 --> 00:48:05,707
Humm?

436
00:48:05,707 --> 00:48:07,963
From Urnbradge.

437
00:48:07,963 --> 00:48:10,553
What happened to your clothes?

438
00:48:10,553 --> 00:48:14,813
I outgrew them.
I´ve been growing an afwul lot lately

439
00:48:14,813 --> 00:48:17,904
I tower over everyone in Urnbradge.

440
00:48:17,904 --> 00:48:19,868
They laugh at me.

441
00:48:19,868 --> 00:48:23,209
So I´ve come to you,
hoping you might understand what it´s like.

442
00:48:23,209 --> 00:48:28,305
My dear girl, anyone with a head
that large is welcome in my court.

443
00:48:28,305 --> 00:48:30,268
Someone find us some clothes!

444
00:48:30,268 --> 00:48:33,317
Use curtains, if you must,
but clothed this enormous girl

445
00:48:43,592 --> 00:48:45,222
I need a pig here!

446
00:48:50,485 --> 00:48:53,367
I love a warm pig belly for
my aching feet

447
00:48:53,367 --> 00:48:55,037
Would you like one, Humm?

448
00:48:55,037 --> 00:48:57,335
- No, thank you.
- Sit!

449
00:49:00,467 --> 00:49:01,554
Sit!

450
00:49:05,479 --> 00:49:06,774
Go away!

451
00:49:09,991 --> 00:49:12,246
Where are my fat boys?
You must meet them.

452
00:49:12,246 --> 00:49:13,876
Fat Boys!

453
00:49:17,509 --> 00:49:19,514
There they are.
Aren´t they adorAble?

454
00:49:19,514 --> 00:49:23,023
They have the oddest way of speaking.
Speak, boys. Amuse us.

455
00:49:30,625 --> 00:49:31,836
Speak!

456
00:49:33,298 --> 00:49:35,511
- Is that being..
- No,no, it is not a bit, no

457
00:49:35,511 --> 00:49:38,101
I´m sure it was, I believe it´s so

458
00:49:38,101 --> 00:49:40,357
No it ain´t, son. No how

459
00:49:43,657 --> 00:49:45,244
I love my Fat Boys

460
00:49:45,244 --> 00:49:46,957
Now, get out!

461
00:50:16,195 --> 00:50:20,079
And.. who is this
lovely creature?

462
00:50:22,628 --> 00:50:25,593
- Humm. My new favorite.
- Does she have a name?

463
00:50:25,593 --> 00:50:26,429
Humm.

464
00:50:26,429 --> 00:50:29,561
I believe your name has slipped the Queen´s mind.

465
00:50:29,561 --> 00:50:31,650
Her name is Humm, Idiot!

466
00:50:33,446 --> 00:50:34,824
From Urnbradge.

467
00:50:34,824 --> 00:50:36,954
Any luck with the prisoner?

468
00:50:36,954 --> 00:50:38,667
He´s stubborn.

469
00:50:38,667 --> 00:50:41,048
Or too soft.

470
00:50:41,048 --> 00:50:43,053
Bring him!

471
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:09,703
We know Alice has returned to Underland,
do you know where she is?

472
00:51:12,876 --> 00:51:15,843
I´ve been considering things that
begin with the letter M

473
00:51:15,843 --> 00:51:18,223
Moron

474
00:51:18,223 --> 00:51:23,152
Mutiny, Murder, Malice

475
00:51:23,152 --> 00:51:25,908
We´re looking for an A word now

476
00:51:25,908 --> 00:51:27,663
Where is Alice?

477
00:51:27,663 --> 00:51:32,007
I would not know.

478
00:51:32,007 --> 00:51:34,890
What if I take off your head?
Will you know then?

479
00:51:36,685 --> 00:51:37,562
Stop it.

480
00:51:39,233 --> 00:51:41,697
What a regrettAbly large head you have

481
00:51:41,697 --> 00:51:44,371
I would very much like to hat it.

482
00:51:44,371 --> 00:51:46,292
- Hat it?
- Yes.

483
00:51:46,292 --> 00:51:48,547
I used to have the White Queen you know

484
00:51:48,547 --> 00:51:52,432
Wasn´t very much to work with, poor dear
Her head is so small

485
00:51:52,474 --> 00:51:55,398
It´s tiny.
It´s a pimple of a head

486
00:51:57,779 --> 00:52:00,954
What I could do with this monument,

487
00:52:00,954 --> 00:52:04,169
with this all..

488
00:52:04,169 --> 00:52:09,266
with this magnificently heroic globe

489
00:52:12,941 --> 00:52:14,361
What could you do?

490
00:52:16,366 --> 00:52:17,995
Unbind him, Stayne.

491
00:52:17,995 --> 00:52:20,836
How can he work, when his hands
are bound?

492
00:52:29,858 --> 00:52:33,032
Well then...

493
00:52:33,032 --> 00:52:34,202
Shall it be a bond or a bowlock?

494
00:52:34,202 --> 00:52:36,332
Or something for the boudoir?

495
00:52:48,152 --> 00:52:49,364
Hatter!

496
00:52:55,170 --> 00:52:56,715
Leave us!

497
00:53:09,497 --> 00:53:12,463
Have you been speaking with him?

498
00:53:12,463 --> 00:53:13,883
Yes, Your Majesty.

499
00:53:13,883 --> 00:53:16,138
Perhaps a bit more kindly

500
00:53:19,354 --> 00:53:22,320
Would you all excuse me for a moment?
Thank you.

501
00:53:32,721 --> 00:53:36,563
- What news, Bayard?
- Alice has returned to Underland.

502
00:53:36,563 --> 00:53:38,360
Where is she now?

503
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:40,406
In Salazin Grum.

504
00:53:40,406 --> 00:53:45,293
Forgive me, I allowed her to
divert from her destined path.

505
00:53:45,293 --> 00:53:49,888
That is exactly where she´ll
will find the Volpen Sword

506
00:53:49,888 --> 00:53:54,357
We have our champion. Rest now.
You have done well!

507
00:54:12,263 --> 00:54:14,226
Have you seen a hat ´round here?

508
00:54:28,344 --> 00:54:29,890
You must find Alice, Stayne.

509
00:54:29,890 --> 00:54:33,064
Without JAbberwocky, my sister´s followers
will shortly rise against me

510
00:54:35,111 --> 00:54:38,578
My ugly little sister
Why do they adore her, but not me?

511
00:54:38,578 --> 00:54:40,248
I can not fadden it

512
00:54:40,248 --> 00:54:45,302
You are far superior in all ways

513
00:54:45,302 --> 00:54:49,062
I know. But Moana can have
anyone fall in love with her.

514
00:54:49,062 --> 00:54:51,234
Men.

515
00:54:51,234 --> 00:54:52,947
Women.

516
00:54:56,497 --> 00:54:58,418
Even the furniture.

517
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:02,804
Even the.. King?

518
00:55:09,362 --> 00:55:12,452
I had to do it.
He would have left me

519
00:55:14,876 --> 00:55:15,961
Majesty ...

520
00:55:17,716 --> 00:55:22,268
It is not better to be feared
than be loved?

521
00:55:23,354 --> 00:55:25,359
Not certain anymore

522
00:55:26,905 --> 00:55:30,581
Let her have them rebel
I don´t need them.

523
00:55:30,581 --> 00:55:32,335
I have you.

524
00:55:51,925 --> 00:55:54,347
They are wonderful.

525
00:55:54,347 --> 00:55:57,272
You must let me try one on

526
00:55:57,272 --> 00:56:00,822
It's good to be working
with my trade again

527
00:56:02,117 --> 00:56:04,497
It's just a pity you have to
make them for her

528
00:56:09,802 --> 00:56:12,182
What does the hatter with mean?

529
00:56:25,633 --> 00:56:26,761
Hatter!

530
00:56:28,723 --> 00:56:32,065
Do you have any idea why a raven is
like a writing desk?

531
00:56:32,065 --> 00:56:34,446
I'm frightened, Alice.

532
00:56:34,446 --> 00:56:37,620
I don´t like it in here.
It's terribly crowded.

533
00:56:41,672 --> 00:56:44,178
Have I gone mad?

534
00:56:48,397 --> 00:56:51,655
Afraid so.
You´re entirely bonkers

535
00:56:51,655 --> 00:56:54,955
But I´ll tell you a secret.

536
00:56:54,955 --> 00:56:57,712
All the best people are.

537
00:57:04,937 --> 00:57:06,190
Here.

538
00:57:09,282 --> 00:57:12,247
That´s better.
You look yourself again.

539
00:57:15,087 --> 00:57:18,679
Hat man? Where are my hats
I am no a patient person

540
00:57:18,805 --> 00:57:21,353
I´m told she has the Vorpal sword hidden in the castle.

541
00:57:21,353 --> 00:57:26,281
The rabbit will help you.
Find it,Alice. Take it to the White Queen.

542
00:57:26,281 --> 00:57:28,161
We´ll go to the White Queen together.

543
00:57:28,161 --> 00:57:33,383
Why is it, you´re always too smal or too tall?

544
00:57:45,453 --> 00:57:48,210
- Tweedles
- Alice, how are you doing, kid?

545
00:57:48,210 --> 00:57:50,968
- Where is the rabbit?
- How is it, you´re being so great big?

546
00:57:50,968 --> 00:57:53,306
She ain´t great big.
This is how she normal is

547
00:57:53,306 --> 00:57:55,562
I'm sure she is smaller when we met

548
00:57:55,562 --> 00:57:58,945
No, she drink "pishsalver" to get
through the door, recall it?

549
00:58:00,742 --> 00:58:02,579
- Where is the rabbit?
- There.

550
00:58:12,312 --> 00:58:14,400
- What are you doing here?
- I´m rescuing The Hatter.

551
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,154
I am rescuing The Hatter!

552
00:58:16,154 --> 00:58:18,660
He told me that the Vorpal sword
is hidden in the castle.

553
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:20,164
Help me find it!

554
00:58:20,164 --> 00:58:23,214
I don´t take orders from big,
clumpsy, galumphing...

555
00:58:28,351 --> 00:58:31,484
- What is it, Big Twisp?
- I know where the sword is.

556
00:58:38,334 --> 00:58:40,213
The sword is hidden inside.

557
00:58:41,884 --> 00:58:43,596
Be careful, Alice.

558
00:59:04,356 --> 00:59:05,943
I´m not going in there!

559
00:59:05,943 --> 00:59:09,535
Look what that thing did to my arm!

560
00:59:09,535 --> 00:59:13,378
Dear Oh dear,
Why haven´t you mentioned this?

561
00:59:13,378 --> 00:59:15,800
It wasn´t this bad before

562
00:59:31,214 --> 00:59:32,425
Hatter!

563
00:59:33,094 --> 00:59:34,430
Where are you?

564
00:59:36,142 --> 00:59:37,187
Hatter!

565
00:59:38,774 --> 00:59:40,069
Mallymkun.

566
00:59:40,069 --> 00:59:42,616
Do you still have the
Bandersnatch's eye ?

567
00:59:42,616 --> 00:59:44,496
Right here.

568
00:59:44,496 --> 00:59:47,462
- I need it.
- Come and get it.

569
00:59:50,261 --> 00:59:51,681
Give it back!

570
01:00:05,925 --> 01:00:10,602
I like you Humm
I like large things ...

571
01:00:10,602 --> 01:00:12,190
Get away from me!

572
01:00:30,317 --> 01:00:31,821
I have your eye.

573
01:01:44,917 --> 01:01:45,794
No.

574
01:01:50,181 --> 01:01:54,106
- You look stunning in that hat.
- Yes. Next!

575
01:01:58,116 --> 01:02:01,041
Your Majesty has never looked
better!

576
01:02:01,041 --> 01:02:03,003
Another!

577
01:02:13,822 --> 01:02:18,208
I don´t wish to alarm you,but I smell as
though you might have dropped something.

578
01:02:31,908 --> 01:02:34,122
Don´t mind him, he´s mad
Come along!

579
01:02:40,429 --> 01:02:43,604
Stayne!

580
01:03:37,569 --> 01:03:39,992
I suppose that make us even now

581
01:04:20,425 --> 01:04:25,270
Humm forced herself on me. I told her
my heart belongs to you

582
01:04:25,270 --> 01:04:29,488
She´s obsessed with me.

583
01:04:34,375 --> 01:04:36,213
Off with the head!

584
01:04:39,095 --> 01:04:42,646
Stand back, Mallymkun.
How is this for muchness?

585
01:04:42,646 --> 01:04:44,735
It mustn´t be used for anything...

586
01:04:46,865 --> 01:04:49,830
Arrested that girl
for unlawful seduction!

587
01:04:49,830 --> 01:04:51,250
Hatter!

588
01:04:53,589 --> 01:04:55,929
- Take it to the White Queen!
- I´m not leaving without you!

589
01:04:55,929 --> 01:04:57,056
Go!

590
01:05:23,747 --> 01:05:25,961
Run...
Alice!

591
01:05:28,467 --> 01:05:29,845
Alice.

592
01:05:30,931 --> 01:05:32,101
Run!

593
01:05:37,823 --> 01:05:39,410
Seize her!

594
01:05:50,897 --> 01:05:52,025
Alice ...

595
01:05:53,069 --> 01:05:55,199
Of course
Why didn´t I see it?

596
01:05:55,199 --> 01:06:01,172
But it has been such a long time
you was such a little tike then

597
01:06:01,172 --> 01:06:03,887
Give me the sword.

598
01:06:05,057 --> 01:06:07,396
- Stay back.
- The queen will be so pleased

599
01:06:07,396 --> 01:06:11,866
Shee will take great pleasure
in cutting off your head.

600
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:34,170
Ho! Alice!

601
01:06:34,170 --> 01:06:36,342
Bayard!
To Marmoreal!

602
01:06:44,696 --> 01:06:47,578
Majesty ...
Alice has escaped.

603
01:06:51,713 --> 01:06:54,554
On ... the Bandersnatch.

604
01:06:56,851 --> 01:06:59,984
With ... the Vorpal sword.

605
01:07:02,657 --> 01:07:04,537
How could you let it happen?

606
01:07:04,537 --> 01:07:08,045
I might have underestimated her

607
01:07:08,045 --> 01:07:15,856
But we have her conspirators.
The Hatter and a door mouse.

608
01:07:15,856 --> 01:07:18,028
Off with their heads!

609
01:07:37,409 --> 01:07:40,793
- Welcome to Marmoreal.
- I believe this belongs to you.

610
01:07:54,743 --> 01:07:57,333
The Vorpal sword is home again

611
01:07:59,589 --> 01:08:01,844
The Armor is complete

612
01:08:04,852 --> 01:08:08,569
Now all we need is a champion

613
01:08:10,072 --> 01:08:12,202
You're a little taller than
I thought you'd be

614
01:08:12,286 --> 01:08:14,751
Blame it on too much Upelkuchen.

615
01:08:15,848 --> 01:08:17,560
Come with me.

616
01:08:22,825 --> 01:08:24,663
Is the March Hare here?

617
01:08:28,756 --> 01:08:30,008
It could use some salt.

618
01:08:35,690 --> 01:08:37,110
Yes, that´s great

619
01:08:38,363 --> 01:08:41,454
Be sure About it, we need

620
01:08:41,454 --> 01:08:44,753
A pinch of worm fat

621
01:08:50,685 --> 01:08:53,399
Buttered fingers.

622
01:08:57,556 --> 01:09:03,152
My sister prefered to study
"Dominion Of The Living Things"

623
01:09:05,324 --> 01:09:09,041
- Tell me, how did she seem to you?
- Perfectly horrid

624
01:09:11,171 --> 01:09:15,223
- And... her head?
- Bulbous

625
01:09:15,223 --> 01:09:21,238
I think she might have some growth
in there, something pressing on her brain

626
01:09:21,238 --> 01:09:23,870
Three coins from a dead man´s pocket

627
01:09:23,870 --> 01:09:27,128
Two tea spoons of "wishful thinking".

628
01:09:27,128 --> 01:09:30,135
You can´t iamgine the things that
go on in that place

629
01:09:31,222 --> 01:09:32,892
Yes, I can.

630
01:09:32,892 --> 01:09:37,947
But when a champion steps
forward to slay the JAbberwocky,

631
01:09:37,947 --> 01:09:40,828
the people will rise against her.

632
01:09:43,961 --> 01:09:45,297
That should do it!

633
01:09:48,974 --> 01:09:50,101
Blow.

634
01:10:04,595 --> 01:10:06,851
- Feeling better?
- Much Thank you.

635
01:10:06,851 --> 01:10:09,398
There´s someone here who´d like
to speak with you

636
01:10:30,617 --> 01:10:33,123
- Absolem!
- Who are you?

637
01:10:37,425 --> 01:10:39,013
I thought we´d settled this

638
01:10:39,013 --> 01:10:41,895
I'm Alice, but not that one

639
01:10:41,895 --> 01:10:43,315
How do you know?

640
01:10:43,315 --> 01:10:45,362
You´ve said so yourself

641
01:10:45,362 --> 01:10:47,409
I said you were hardly Alice,

642
01:10:47,409 --> 01:10:52,129
but you´re much more her now.
In fact, you are almost Alice.

643
01:10:52,129 --> 01:10:55,554
Even so, I could not slay the
JAbberwocky

644
01:10:55,637 --> 01:10:57,600
if my life depended on it

645
01:10:57,684 --> 01:11:00,106
It will

646
01:11:00,190 --> 01:11:04,451
So suggest you keep the Vorpal Sword
hand for when the FrAbjous Day arrives

647
01:11:05,536 --> 01:11:07,249
You seem so real.

648
01:11:07,249 --> 01:11:10,381
Sometimes I forget that this is all a dream.

649
01:11:14,016 --> 01:11:15,436
Will you stop doing that?

650
01:11:35,110 --> 01:11:37,698
I have always admired
that hat.

651
01:11:37,698 --> 01:11:39,913
Hello, Chess.

652
01:11:40,706 --> 01:11:43,045
Since you wouldn´t be needing it anymore

653
01:11:43,045 --> 01:11:47,515
would you consider begrieving it to me

654
01:11:47,515 --> 01:11:49,478
How dare you?

655
01:11:49,478 --> 01:11:52,945
It is an formal execution.
I would like to look my best, you know

656
01:11:52,945 --> 01:11:56,119
It´s a pity About all this

657
01:11:56,119 --> 01:11:59,335
I was looking forward to seeing
you Futterwacken

658
01:11:59,335 --> 01:12:02,176
I was ready good at it, was I not?

659
01:12:02,176 --> 01:12:05,684
I really DO love that hat.

660
01:12:06,979 --> 01:12:09,861
I´d wear to all the finest occasions.

661
01:12:17,379 --> 01:12:19,593
I love a morning execution
Don´t you?

662
01:12:19,593 --> 01:12:21,306
Yes, Your Majesty.

663
01:13:05,289 --> 01:13:08,213
- I would like to keep it on.
- Suit yourself

664
01:13:08,213 --> 01:13:10,510
As long as I can get at your neck

665
01:13:13,267 --> 01:13:15,314
I´m right here, behind ya

666
01:13:15,314 --> 01:13:17,694
- Off with his head!
- I can´t watch.

667
01:13:51,987 --> 01:13:53,867
Good morning, everyone.

668
01:13:53,867 --> 01:13:56,832
Chess, you dog!

669
01:13:59,172 --> 01:14:00,257
Madam?

670
01:14:00,257 --> 01:14:05,061
You are being hanously bamboozled by these
lick spittled toves you surround yourself with

671
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:11,242
What is that?

672
01:14:11,242 --> 01:14:15,336
- I´m not the only one Majesty. Look.
- A counterfeit nose. You should be ashamed!

673
01:14:15,336 --> 01:14:18,887
Me? What About that big belly
you´re so proud off?

674
01:14:24,066 --> 01:14:25,277
Liars! Cheats!

675
01:14:26,906 --> 01:14:30,916
Off with their heads!

676
01:14:35,845 --> 01:14:39,061
The Abused and enslaved
in the Red Queen´s court!

677
01:14:39,061 --> 01:14:41,985
All of you, stand up and fight!

678
01:14:41,985 --> 01:14:45,745
Rise up against the Bloody Red Queen!

679
01:14:48,334 --> 01:14:50,757
Downal wyth Bluddy Behg Hid!

680
01:14:57,732 --> 01:14:59,779
Release the Jubjub bird!

681
01:15:24,089 --> 01:15:28,767
You were right, Stayne.
It's far better to be feared than loved.

682
01:15:33,236 --> 01:15:34,991
Come with me! Quick, come!

683
01:15:39,626 --> 01:15:41,841
- Hatter!
- Come on, Melly, quickly! Come on!

684
01:15:44,890 --> 01:15:46,895
Prepare the JAbberwocky for battle.

685
01:15:46,895 --> 01:15:49,860
We're going to visit
my little sister.

686
01:16:00,052 --> 01:16:02,850
I had hope to have a champion by now

687
01:16:05,232 --> 01:16:07,570
Why don´t you slay the
JAbberwocky yourself?

688
01:16:07,570 --> 01:16:09,283
You must have the power.

689
01:16:09,283 --> 01:16:12,583
It is against my vows to harm
any living creature.

690
01:16:21,856 --> 01:16:23,442
We have company.

691
01:16:33,467 --> 01:16:35,306
Have a look, Bayard.

692
01:16:47,711 --> 01:16:50,843
- So happy to see you, I thought they were going to...
- Send me to die, but they didn´t.

693
01:16:50,843 --> 01:16:53,016
And here I am, still in one piece!

694
01:16:53,016 --> 01:16:55,689
I´d rather have died than
never seeing you again

695
01:16:55,689 --> 01:17:00,576
I would regret not seeing you
especially since you are you,

696
01:17:00,576 --> 01:17:04,335
in the proper size. It a great
size, it the right size, it´s..

697
01:17:04,335 --> 01:17:05,965
Hatter.

698
01:17:08,136 --> 01:17:09,640
Where´s your hat.

699
01:17:15,697 --> 01:17:18,077
- Cheshire.
- How´s the arm, love?

700
01:17:19,205 --> 01:17:23,632
- All healed.
- Goodbye, sweet hat

701
01:17:42,804 --> 01:17:47,066
Have you any idea why a raven is
like a writing desk?

702
01:17:49,780 --> 01:17:51,743
Let me think About it.

703
01:17:52,955 --> 01:17:55,836
You know what tomorrow is, don´t you?

704
01:17:59,220 --> 01:18:01,726
FrAbjous Day, how I could forget?

705
01:18:01,726 --> 01:18:04,525
I wish I´d wake up.

706
01:18:06,153 --> 01:18:08,827
You still believe this is
a dream, do you?

707
01:18:08,827 --> 01:18:10,456
Of course

708
01:18:10,456 --> 01:18:13,505
This all coming from my own mind.

709
01:18:16,137 --> 01:18:20,063
Which would mean that I´m not real.

710
01:18:23,362 --> 01:18:25,159
Afraid so.

711
01:18:25,159 --> 01:18:28,334
You're just a figment of my
imagination

712
01:18:28,334 --> 01:18:31,759
I would dream up someone who´s half mad

713
01:18:31,759 --> 01:18:36,812
Yes, yes. But you would have to be´
half mad to dream me up.

714
01:18:39,987 --> 01:18:41,532
I must be then.

715
01:18:46,586 --> 01:18:48,759
I´ll miss you when I wake up.

716
01:19:03,879 --> 01:19:07,931
Who will step forth to be
champion for the White Queen?

717
01:19:07,931 --> 01:19:11,398
That would be I

718
01:19:13,026 --> 01:19:16,118
You have any poor evaporating skills

719
01:19:16,118 --> 01:19:17,788
I should be the one.

720
01:19:17,788 --> 01:19:19,250
I´ll do it

721
01:19:19,250 --> 01:19:21,255
No, me.

722
01:19:21,255 --> 01:19:23,594
No, me!

723
01:19:40,469 --> 01:19:45,022
No other slayer, no how
If it ain´t Alice, it ain´t dead

724
01:19:51,496 --> 01:19:52,916
Alice ...

725
01:19:54,211 --> 01:19:56,133
You cannot live your life
to please others,

726
01:19:56,133 --> 01:19:59,474
The choice must be yours.

727
01:19:59,474 --> 01:20:02,774
Because when you step out to face that creature,

728
01:20:04,403 --> 01:20:06,408
you will step out alone

729
01:20:40,742 --> 01:20:44,502
Nothing was ever accomplished with tears

730
01:20:44,502 --> 01:20:46,882
Absolem?

731
01:20:48,344 --> 01:20:50,224
Why are you upside down?

732
01:20:50,224 --> 01:20:52,981
I´ve come to the end of this life.

733
01:20:52,981 --> 01:20:55,069
You´re going to die?

734
01:20:55,069 --> 01:20:57,199
Transform.

735
01:20:57,199 --> 01:21:00,833
You can´t go. I need our
help, I don´t know what to do.

736
01:21:00,833 --> 01:21:04,634
I can´t help if you don´t even know
who you are, stupid girl.

737
01:21:04,634 --> 01:21:06,431
I´m not stupid!

738
01:21:06,472 --> 01:21:09,354
My name is Alice,
I live in London.

739
01:21:09,354 --> 01:21:12,194
I have a mother named Helen
and a sister named Margaret.

740
01:21:12,194 --> 01:21:14,701
My father was Charles Kingsley.

741
01:21:14,701 --> 01:21:18,293
He had a vision that stretched halfway around
the world and nothing ever stopped him

742
01:21:18,293 --> 01:21:20,715
I am his daughter.

743
01:21:20,715 --> 01:21:22,345
I'm Alice Kingsley.

744
01:21:22,678 --> 01:21:26,145
Alice ... At last!

745
01:21:26,145 --> 01:21:28,526
You are just as dimwitted as
the first time you were here

746
01:21:28,526 --> 01:21:31,200
You called it Wonderland, as I recall

747
01:21:34,207 --> 01:21:36,128
Wonderland.

748
01:21:36,128 --> 01:21:40,514
<i> - What do you call yourself?
- Alice. </ I></i>

749
01:21:40,514 --> 01:21:42,394
<i> THE Alice? </ i></i>

750
01:21:42,394 --> 01:21:46,195
<i> I´ll take you to the Hare
and the Hatter. </ i></i>

751
01:21:46,195 --> 01:21:47,907
<i> She the right one,
I'm certain. </ I></i>

752
01:21:47,991 --> 01:21:51,332
<i> Look at the tAble.
Please, have some tea. </ I></i>

753
01:21:53,296 --> 01:21:56,637
<i> Stupid Girl.
- And what is this? </ I></i>

754
01:21:59,728 --> 01:22:03,946
<i> You would think she would
remember all this from the first time. </ i></i>

755
01:22:05,492 --> 01:22:08,666
It wasn´t a dream at all.
It was a memory.

756
01:22:08,666 --> 01:22:10,922
This place is real!

757
01:22:10,922 --> 01:22:13,261
So are you and so is the Hatter!

758
01:22:13,261 --> 01:22:16,353
And the JAbberwocky

759
01:22:16,353 --> 01:22:20,070
Remember, the Vorpal Sword knows
what it wants

760
01:22:20,070 --> 01:22:23,620
All you have to do, is hold on to it.

761
01:22:25,625 --> 01:22:31,682
Farewell, Alice.
Perhaps I will see you in another life.

762
01:24:31,100 --> 01:24:32,729
Hello, Iracebeth.

763
01:24:32,729 --> 01:24:35,570
Hello ... 
Mirana

764
01:24:38,911 --> 01:24:41,500
On this, the FrAbjous day,

765
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:45,845
The Queens, Red and White shall
send forth their champions

766
01:24:45,845 --> 01:24:48,810
to do battle on their behalf.

767
01:24:48,810 --> 01:24:53,948
Iracy, we don´t have to fight

768
01:24:55,827 --> 01:24:57,916
I know what you´re doing.

769
01:24:57,916 --> 01:25:01,007
You think you can blink
those pretty little eyes

770
01:25:01,049 --> 01:25:04,223
and I´ll melt, just like
mommy and daddy did.

771
01:25:06,562 --> 01:25:08,651
Please.

772
01:25:08,651 --> 01:25:09,987
No!

773
01:25:10,029 --> 01:25:14,373
It's my crown!
I am the eldest!

774
01:25:14,373 --> 01:25:16,879
JAbberwocky!

775
01:26:04,120 --> 01:26:05,749
This is impossible.

776
01:26:05,749 --> 01:26:08,632
Only if you believe it is

777
01:26:14,437 --> 01:26:19,575
"Sometimes I believe as many as six
impossible things before breakfast. "

778
01:26:20,494 --> 01:26:22,874
That´s excellent practice

779
01:26:24,838 --> 01:26:32,064
However, just at the moment,
you really might want to focus on the JAbberwocky

780
01:26:38,329 --> 01:26:40,626
Where 's your champion, sister?

781
01:26:42,089 --> 01:26:43,258
Here.

782
01:26:45,556 --> 01:26:47,560
Hello, Humm.

783
01:27:01,052 --> 01:27:04,310
Six impossible things.
Count them, Alice.

784
01:27:08,695 --> 01:27:11,620
One. There´s a potion that
can make you shrink

785
01:27:15,379 --> 01:27:18,512
Two. A cake that can make you grow.

786
01:27:18,512 --> 01:27:21,602
So, my old foe

787
01:27:21,602 --> 01:27:25,111
We meet on the battlefield, once again

788
01:27:26,448 --> 01:27:30,039
- We've never met.
- Not you, insignificant bearer.

789
01:27:31,126 --> 01:27:36,054
My ancient enemy, the Vorpal one

790
01:27:36,054 --> 01:27:38,352
That´s enough chatter!

791
01:27:46,121 --> 01:27:49,003
Three. Animals can talk.

792
01:27:54,433 --> 01:27:57,148
Four. Alice ...

793
01:27:58,235 --> 01:27:59,947
Cats can disappear.

794
01:28:02,745 --> 01:28:04,123
Five.

795
01:28:06,672 --> 01:28:08,677
There is a place called
Wonderland

796
01:28:10,055 --> 01:28:11,183
Six.

797
01:28:11,893 --> 01:28:14,315
I can slay the JAbberwocky

798
01:28:39,461 --> 01:28:42,176
The Hatter is interfering !
Off with his head!

799
01:31:09,956 --> 01:31:11,877
Off with your head!

800
01:31:43,872 --> 01:31:45,836
Kill her!

801
01:31:45,836 --> 01:31:48,717
We follow you no more,
Bloody Big Head!

802
01:31:48,717 --> 01:31:50,054
How dare you?

803
01:31:50,054 --> 01:31:51,851
Off with his head!

804
01:32:33,202 --> 01:32:35,249
Iracebeth off Crims,

805
01:32:35,249 --> 01:32:38,507
your crimes against Underland
are worthy off death

806
01:32:40,845 --> 01:32:42,140
However,

807
01:32:42,140 --> 01:32:45,147
that is against my vows.

808
01:32:45,147 --> 01:32:47,989
Therefore you will be banished
to the Outlands

809
01:32:47,989 --> 01:32:52,374
No one is to show you any kindness
or ever speak a word to you.

810
01:32:55,465 --> 01:32:58,013
You will not have a friend in
the world ...

811
01:32:59,976 --> 01:33:04,613
Majesty, I hope you bare on me no
ill will

812
01:33:07,871 --> 01:33:10,418
Iracy won´t be alone Stayne

813
01:33:10,418 --> 01:33:12,591
you are to join Iracebeth in banishment

814
01:33:12,591 --> 01:33:15,013
from this day on, until the end of Underland.

815
01:33:18,271 --> 01:33:20,693
Even we have each other.

816
01:33:33,684 --> 01:33:37,987
Majesty, please, kill me!
Please!

817
01:33:37,987 --> 01:33:41,077
But you do not owe your my kindness

818
01:33:41,077 --> 01:33:43,792
- Take off my head!
- You tried to kill me?

819
01:33:43,792 --> 01:33:46,757
- Majesty! Please!
- He tried to kill me!

820
01:33:46,757 --> 01:33:48,888
He tried to kill me!

821
01:33:48,888 --> 01:33:52,522
O FrAbjous Day!

822
01:33:59,456 --> 01:34:02,756
- What is he doing?
- Futterwacken.

823
01:34:49,077 --> 01:34:50,999
The blood of the JAbberwocky.

824
01:34:50,999 --> 01:34:54,215
You have our everlasting gratitude.

825
01:34:54,215 --> 01:34:57,891
And for your efforts
on our behalf ...

826
01:35:00,982 --> 01:35:04,407
- Will this take me home?
- If that is what you choose.

827
01:35:30,638 --> 01:35:32,685
You could stay.

828
01:35:35,818 --> 01:35:40,036
What an idea?
A crazy mad wonderful idea!

829
01:35:45,675 --> 01:35:47,471
But I can´t

830
01:35:47,471 --> 01:35:51,022
They are questions I have to answer

831
01:35:51,022 --> 01:35:53,068
Things I have to do.

832
01:36:01,297 --> 01:36:04,221
I´ll be back again, before you know it

833
01:36:04,221 --> 01:36:07,395
You won´t remember me.

834
01:36:07,395 --> 01:36:11,321
Off course I will.
How could I forget?

835
01:36:15,414 --> 01:36:20,176
Hatter,why is a raven
like a writing desk?

836
01:36:20,176 --> 01:36:24,729
I haven´t the slightest idea

837
01:36:29,199 --> 01:36:31,203
Fairfarren Alice.

838
01:37:17,537 --> 01:37:21,118
She left me standing there
without an answer

839
01:37:21,118 --> 01:37:23,374
A case of nerves, no doubt

840
01:37:26,381 --> 01:37:28,804
- Alice.
- God, lord!

841
01:37:28,804 --> 01:37:31,811
- Are you alright?
- What happened to you?

842
01:37:31,811 --> 01:37:34,317
I fell down a hole
and hit my head.

843
01:37:34,317 --> 01:37:37,993
I'm sorry, Hamish,
I can´t marry you.

844
01:37:37,993 --> 01:37:40,290
You´re not the right man for me.

845
01:37:40,290 --> 01:37:43,757
You´ll always have problems with your digestion.

846
01:37:43,757 --> 01:37:47,725
I love you, Margaret,
but this is my life.

847
01:37:47,725 --> 01:37:50,648
I´ll decide what to do with it.

848
01:37:53,155 --> 01:37:56,205
You're lucky to my sister for
your wife, Lowell.

849
01:37:56,205 --> 01:38:00,965
I know you´ll be good to her.
I'll be watching very closely.

850
01:38:02,929 --> 01:38:05,519
There is no prince, Aunt Imogen

851
01:38:05,519 --> 01:38:08,819
You need to talk to somebody
About these delusions

852
01:38:10,824 --> 01:38:14,207
I happen to like rabbits,
especially white ones.

853
01:38:17,214 --> 01:38:21,182
Do not worry, Mother.
I´ll find something useful to do with my life.

854
01:38:23,731 --> 01:38:26,946
You two remind me of some funny boys
I met in a dream

855
01:38:29,536 --> 01:38:32,586
- You´ve left me out.
- No, I haven´t, sir.

856
01:38:32,586 --> 01:38:35,468
You and I have business to discuss

857
01:38:35,468 --> 01:38:38,558
Shall we speak... in the study

858
01:38:45,951 --> 01:38:47,706
Oh, and one more thing.

859
01:38:55,433 --> 01:38:59,443
My father told me he wanted to expand
his trade routes to Sumatra and Borneo

860
01:38:59,485 --> 01:39:02,325
But I don´t not think he was looking
far enough.

861
01:39:02,325 --> 01:39:05,124
Why not go all the way to China?

862
01:39:05,124 --> 01:39:08,298
It's vast, the culture´s rich

863
01:39:08,298 --> 01:39:10,220
and we have a foothole in Hong Kong.

864
01:39:10,303 --> 01:39:14,397
To be the first to trade with China,
Can you imagine it?

865
01:39:16,610 --> 01:39:20,579
You know, if somebody had said that to me,
I´d have said you´ve lost your senses

866
01:39:20,579 --> 01:39:24,087
But I´ve seen that look before

867
01:39:25,173 --> 01:39:27,470
As you´re not going to be my daughter in law,

868
01:39:27,470 --> 01:39:32,023
Perhaps you´d consider becoming an
apprentice with the company?

869
01:40:12,163 --> 01:40:13,875
Hello, Absolem.
