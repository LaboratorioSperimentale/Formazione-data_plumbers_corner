1
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,800
May I go out now, Miss Simpson?

2
00:04:24,299 --> 00:04:26,099
Has it stopped snowing?

3
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:28,406
<i>Not quite.

4
00:04:28,499 --> 00:04:33,100
<i>You need to stop waiting for your sister's
return, perhaps she will take you out.

5
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,606
Oh, dear.

6
00:04:53,298 --> 00:04:55,099
Suppose it never stops?

7
00:04:57,099 --> 00:05:01,399
Suppose the man in charge of the
snow has forgotten how to stop it.

8
00:05:03,998 --> 00:05:07,598
Don't you think you had better
work a while at your sampler?

9
00:05:08,653 --> 00:05:10,153
No, thank you.

10
00:05:13,498 --> 00:05:14,899
Oh dear...

11
00:05:21,297 --> 00:05:23,197
Hello, Sir Turtle.

12
00:05:34,597 --> 00:05:37,297
You really must stop that, Your Majesty.

13
00:05:37,797 --> 00:05:41,398
- Stop it, I say!
- <i>Stop what?

14
00:05:42,097 --> 00:05:46,757
The White Queen just knocked over the White
King, she never does look where she's going.

15
00:05:46,796 --> 00:05:50,996
Alice! You know you are not supposed
to play with your father's chess men.

16
00:05:51,296 --> 00:05:52,995
But I wasn't playing.

17
00:05:53,097 --> 00:05:56,697
She deliberately bumped into His
Majesty and knocked him off his feet.

18
00:05:56,797 --> 00:05:59,496
Alice are you sure that that is true.

19
00:05:59,596 --> 00:06:02,496
- Well, I saw it.
- Alice...

20
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:04,896
Yes, Miss Simpson.

21
00:06:10,395 --> 00:06:12,996
At any rate Your Majesty...

22
00:06:14,395 --> 00:06:18,896
stop bumping into your husband.
You might tidy up a bit.

23
00:06:40,695 --> 00:06:45,994
A white rabbit! All dressed up in a
muffler and overcoat and big woolly suit.

24
00:06:46,494 --> 00:06:50,195
There! It's going into
his nice, warm rabbit hole.

25
00:06:51,094 --> 00:06:53,194
It looks so funny all dressed up.

26
00:06:53,294 --> 00:06:57,294
Alice, I am sure you know
there's no such thing as a rabbit

27
00:06:57,394 --> 00:06:59,893
dressed up in a muffler
and an overcoat.

28
00:06:59,993 --> 00:07:04,894
- You must not say what is not true.
- Well, it wasn't untrue exactly.

29
00:07:05,194 --> 00:07:09,993
I think you had better finish your tea.
There is another egg for you to eat.

30
00:07:10,493 --> 00:07:14,993
Oh I did eat both eggs... but,
I put one of them all back together again.

31
00:07:15,093 --> 00:07:16,792
Alice!

32
00:07:17,292 --> 00:07:19,293
Yes, Miss Simpson.

33
00:07:28,893 --> 00:07:30,941
The looking glass room.

34
00:07:42,191 --> 00:07:45,392
You see Dinah, as soon as I hold you up,

35
00:07:45,592 --> 00:07:47,651
the little girl in the looking glass room,

36
00:07:47,678 --> 00:07:49,793
holds up another cat just like you.

37
00:07:50,842 --> 00:07:55,391
Oh, Dinah! Wouldn't you like to see
what the looking glass house is like?

38
00:08:06,492 --> 00:08:09,991
You know Dinah,
there is a looking glass house.

39
00:08:10,591 --> 00:08:13,290
First there's the room you
can see through the glass.

40
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:16,291
That's just the same
as our sitting room.

41
00:08:16,591 --> 00:08:18,591
Only the same, goes the other way.

42
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,590
You'd love living there.

43
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:25,990
But, of course, I don't whether
looking glass milk is good to drink.

44
00:08:26,991 --> 00:08:30,391
<i>Well anyway, then we
would come to the hallway.

45
00:08:30,565 --> 00:08:34,402
It is very like our own
hallway, as far as you can see.

46
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:38,990
Only it may be quite
different... beyond that.

47
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:41,789
Oh Dinah...

48
00:08:43,158 --> 00:08:48,239
wouldn't it be nice... if we
could get... through... to...

49
00:09:54,187 --> 00:09:59,287
I can see all of the looking glass
room from here. All, but a bit.

50
00:09:59,987 --> 00:10:04,887
I would so like to see that
little bit, just behind the fireplace.

51
00:10:06,086 --> 00:10:10,387
Do you think, Dinah, that
if I press very, very hard,

52
00:10:10,586 --> 00:10:14,187
and try to look straight
down... that I might...

53
00:10:15,486 --> 00:10:18,386
Why... why...

54
00:10:24,986 --> 00:10:28,785
Well, I knew this part of
the room would be different.

55
00:10:30,885 --> 00:10:34,786
But I do wish the looking glass
chair moved when I moved ours.

56
00:10:34,985 --> 00:10:37,285
Their seems no other way.

57
00:10:45,785 --> 00:10:49,084
If I could only fall
like that all the time.

58
00:11:07,784 --> 00:11:09,484
It can't be English.

59
00:11:18,784 --> 00:11:21,384
Of course, it's the looking glass room.

60
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:34,382
Why, it's uncle and aunt.

61
00:11:35,783 --> 00:11:37,957
I knew that if you could
really get behind the

62
00:11:37,984 --> 00:11:40,083
picture, that you'd see
the backs of people.

63
00:11:40,983 --> 00:11:44,682
Poor uncle Gilbert, his
trousers are all patched.

64
00:11:50,483 --> 00:11:51,789
My dear niece,

65
00:11:51,816 --> 00:11:53,900
how'd you like being
frame in one pair of

66
00:11:53,927 --> 00:11:56,382
trousers for twenty years
without being patched?

67
00:11:57,181 --> 00:11:59,181
It must be very difficult.

68
00:11:59,382 --> 00:12:03,782
It is. But after all, it's only the
front of the picture that counts really.

69
00:12:03,953 --> 00:12:07,103
- Of course.
- That is all.

70
00:12:15,881 --> 00:12:18,882
Bong-bong-bong-bong 8 o'clock.

71
00:12:21,082 --> 00:12:22,182
What did you say?

72
00:12:22,282 --> 00:12:24,780
Bong-bong-bong-bong 8 o'clock.

73
00:12:24,807 --> 00:12:27,073
But your hand says
twenty minutes to four.

74
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:31,083
I never let know my left hand
know what my right hand is doing.

75
00:12:31,114 --> 00:12:34,533
This side of the looking
glass has me all confused.

76
00:12:34,581 --> 00:12:37,780
That's because everything
is backward on your side.

77
00:12:38,288 --> 00:12:40,879
Well, I never...

78
00:12:58,579 --> 00:13:04,575
Ma... mama... mama... mama... mama...

79
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,179
- What's that?
- It's the voice of my child.

80
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:12,479
- Your child!
- Oh!

81
00:13:13,379 --> 00:13:17,180
Oh, my precious lily!
My imperial kitten!

82
00:13:19,979 --> 00:13:23,478
- I must be with my child!
- Let me help you.

83
00:13:27,079 --> 00:13:29,939
- Oh! There!
- Ohhh!

84
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,778
Mama... mama... mama... mama...

85
00:13:38,178 --> 00:13:43,728
There, there my royal pawn.
Ah, poor thing.

86
00:13:48,378 --> 00:13:50,278
Watch out for the volcano!

87
00:13:50,378 --> 00:13:55,377
It blew me up! Be sure you come up
the regular way, don't get blown up!

88
00:13:58,478 --> 00:14:01,487
You'll be hours and hours
getting to the table at that rate,

89
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:03,007
I'd far better help you.

90
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:11,276
<i>No, no! The King's men!
Somebody call out the King's men!

91
00:14:16,377 --> 00:14:20,376
I assure my dear, I shall never,
never forget the horror of this moment.

92
00:14:20,577 --> 00:14:23,476
Well, you will forget, <i>unless
you make a memorandum of it.

93
00:14:24,176 --> 00:14:26,576
I could be very happy to remind you.

94
00:14:26,677 --> 00:14:29,376
We will not be reminded by a volcano.

95
00:14:30,177 --> 00:14:33,872
I'm not a volcano.
And I'm not a cyclone either.

96
00:14:33,954 --> 00:14:36,876
Then you are either a
cyclano or a volcone.

97
00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:40,080
Bong, bong, bong, bong,
bong, bong, bong, bong...

98
00:14:40,376 --> 00:14:42,276
and bong.

99
00:14:44,176 --> 00:14:45,775
But what time is that?

100
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:49,001
I really don't have any idea,
but it's very late.

101
00:14:50,075 --> 00:14:52,949
I must hurry, or shall have
to go back through the looking glass

102
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:55,676
before I've seen what the
rest of the house is like.

103
00:15:26,974 --> 00:15:30,634
My! What a strange way
to walk about the garden.

104
00:15:30,673 --> 00:15:32,174
The Duchess! The Duchess!

105
00:15:32,224 --> 00:15:35,167
Oh, won't she be savage
if I've kept her waiting.

106
00:15:38,674 --> 00:15:41,374
Oh dear, oh dear, I shall be too late.

107
00:16:02,072 --> 00:16:05,172
Oh my ears and whiskers
how late it is getting.

108
00:16:14,572 --> 00:16:16,894
Well... after such a fall at this,

109
00:16:16,944 --> 00:16:20,085
I shall think nothing of
tumbling down stairs.

110
00:16:38,272 --> 00:16:42,472
I wish Dinah were here.
That's just pretty music.

111
00:18:08,868 --> 00:18:10,467
Oh, dear...

112
00:18:50,746 --> 00:18:52,707
Ouch! Ooo!

113
00:18:59,866 --> 00:19:02,269
Goodbye, dear feet.

114
00:19:34,364 --> 00:19:37,864
Oh, will I ever get to
the beautiful garden?

115
00:20:52,161 --> 00:20:53,562
Oh, Mouse!

116
00:20:56,961 --> 00:20:59,846
Do you know the way out of this pool,
oh, Mouse?

117
00:20:59,896 --> 00:21:02,290
I'm very tired of swimming about here.

118
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:06,960
Perhaps you don't understand English.
I daresay, you're a French mouse.

119
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:11,298
Ou est ma chatte? That's
French for "Where is my cat?"

120
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:18,260
I beg your pardon. I quite
forgot you didn't like cats.

121
00:21:18,761 --> 00:21:20,261
Wait, oh, Mouse!

122
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,960
Oh, Mouse?

123
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:29,359
Not like cats?
Would you like cats if you were me?

124
00:21:31,259 --> 00:21:35,659
Don't be angry. I wish I
could show you our cat Dinah.

125
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:39,660
You'd take quite a fancy to her.
She's such a dear quiet thing.

126
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,159
And so good at catching mice.

127
00:21:42,859 --> 00:21:48,033
- Oh, I beg your pardon.
- I hate you! I hate cats!

128
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:52,359
My whole family hates cats.
Nasty, low, vulgar things!

129
00:21:52,859 --> 00:21:54,559
Oh, dear!

130
00:21:58,459 --> 00:21:59,859
Wait, oh, Mouse!

131
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:03,859
Cats! Cats!

132
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:09,958
Cats!

133
00:22:26,157 --> 00:22:29,758
<i>William the Conqueror, whose
cause was favored </i>by the Pope,

134
00:22:29,858 --> 00:22:32,458
was soon submitted to by the English,

135
00:22:32,557 --> 00:22:35,557
who wanted leaders, and had
been of late much accustomed

136
00:22:35,657 --> 00:22:38,256
to usurpation and conquest.

137
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:39,857
Who are you, please?

138
00:22:42,388 --> 00:22:44,140
I am a dodo.

139
00:22:44,718 --> 00:22:47,202
How do you do?
My name is Alice.

140
00:22:47,254 --> 00:22:49,228
And you are very wet.

141
00:22:49,557 --> 00:22:53,656
I'm afraid I am, but there isn't
much I can do about getting dry.

142
00:22:53,756 --> 00:22:58,857
History is the driest thing I know.
Shall we dry you with history?

143
00:22:59,457 --> 00:23:01,556
I'd be much obliged if you could.

144
00:23:01,829 --> 00:23:03,017
Listen well.

145
00:23:03,044 --> 00:23:06,583
Edwin and Morcar,
the earls of Mercia and Northumbria,

146
00:23:06,633 --> 00:23:09,730
<i>found it advisable to
go with Edgar Atheling

147
00:23:09,762 --> 00:23:12,560
<i>to meet William and
offer him</i> the crown.

148
00:23:12,587 --> 00:23:17,394
William's conduct at first was moderate.
<i>But the insolence of his Normans...

149
00:23:17,455 --> 00:23:19,451
How are you getting on, my dear?

150
00:23:19,478 --> 00:23:21,260
Beautifully, thank you!

151
00:23:21,288 --> 00:23:25,255
- Shall I put you to sleep now?
- No, thank you!

152
00:23:25,355 --> 00:23:29,355
Then you'd best run along, I'm
about to recite some dates.

153
00:23:30,056 --> 00:23:32,983
Yes Sir, thank you. Goodbye.

154
00:23:34,154 --> 00:23:39,654
1585, Shakespeare was born,
1616, Shakespeare died.

155
00:23:56,255 --> 00:23:57,855
Who are you?

156
00:24:03,053 --> 00:24:05,301
I hardly know Sir, just at present.

157
00:24:05,328 --> 00:24:08,053
At least I know who I was
when I got up this morning.

158
00:24:08,125 --> 00:24:10,989
But I must have changed
several times since then.

159
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:12,966
What do you mean by that?
Explain yourself.

160
00:24:13,053 --> 00:24:16,254
I can't explain myself,
because I'm not myself, you see.

161
00:24:16,353 --> 00:24:17,853
I don't see!

162
00:24:18,053 --> 00:24:22,439
I can't put it more clearly, for I can't
understand it myself to begin with.

163
00:24:22,466 --> 00:24:26,434
And being so many different
sizes in one day is confusing.

164
00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:27,753
It isn't.

165
00:24:27,953 --> 00:24:32,221
Well when some day you turn into a
chrysalis and after that into a butterfly,

166
00:24:32,248 --> 00:24:33,753
you'll find it a bit clear won't you?

167
00:24:33,853 --> 00:24:35,053
Not a bit!

168
00:24:35,352 --> 00:24:39,352
Well, maybe you wouldn't, but it would
certainly feel very queer to me.

169
00:24:39,553 --> 00:24:41,152
You? Who are you?

170
00:24:42,352 --> 00:24:44,852
I think, you ought to
tell me who you are first.

171
00:24:44,951 --> 00:24:46,552
- Why?
- Good day, Sir.

172
00:24:46,752 --> 00:24:49,552
Come back!
I have something important to say.

173
00:24:49,582 --> 00:24:51,552
- Yes?
- Keep you temper.

174
00:24:51,751 --> 00:24:53,877
- Is that all?
- No.

175
00:24:54,808 --> 00:24:57,006
So you think you've changed, do you?

176
00:24:57,551 --> 00:25:00,770
- I'm afraid I have, Sir.
- What size do you want to be?

177
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:04,258
I should like to be a little
larger Sir, if you wouldn't mind.

178
00:25:04,311 --> 00:25:07,273
Three inches is such
a hard height to be.

179
00:25:07,452 --> 00:25:11,630
I am three inches high!
It's a very good height to be.

180
00:25:11,951 --> 00:25:16,236
I'm sure it must be, Sir, but you see...
I'm not use to it.

181
00:25:16,263 --> 00:25:18,643
You'll get use to it in time.

182
00:25:20,951 --> 00:25:26,147
One side will make you grow taller.
The other side will make you grow shorter.

183
00:25:26,271 --> 00:25:30,150
- One side of... of what?
- The mushroom!

184
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:37,234
- Which side will make me grow larger?
- The large making side, of course!

185
00:25:38,184 --> 00:25:40,650
I'll take a little of both to make sure.

186
00:26:07,849 --> 00:26:11,549
Oh dear, now I'm too
big again, oh, Caterpillar.

187
00:26:11,748 --> 00:26:14,249
Mr. Caterpillar Sir,
where are you?

188
00:26:28,348 --> 00:26:32,394
Whoever lives here, it would
never do to come upon them in this size.

189
00:26:32,421 --> 00:26:34,748
Why, I should frighten
them out of their wits.

190
00:26:53,247 --> 00:26:55,446
For the Du... Du... Du... Du... Duchess.

191
00:26:55,546 --> 00:26:59,547
An invitation from the
Queen to play croquet.

192
00:26:59,612 --> 00:27:03,343
My compliments to the Queen.

193
00:27:03,647 --> 00:27:07,447
My compliments to the Du...
Du... Du... Du... Duchess.

194
00:27:37,145 --> 00:27:40,645
There's no sort of use in your knocking.

195
00:27:45,145 --> 00:27:47,238
Please Sir, how am I to get in?

196
00:27:47,265 --> 00:27:51,339
I shall sit here till tomorrow.

197
00:27:55,044 --> 00:27:58,644
I'm sorry you were hit,
but how am I to get in?

198
00:27:58,748 --> 00:28:03,535
I shall sit here for days and days.

199
00:28:03,745 --> 00:28:08,244
- But what am I to do?
- Anything you like.

200
00:28:39,943 --> 00:28:42,625
Please watch out for the baby!

201
00:28:46,243 --> 00:28:48,543
She nearly killed the poor little thing!

202
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:50,276
If everybody minded
their own business,

203
00:28:50,309 --> 00:28:53,301
the world would go around
much faster than it does.

204
00:28:57,843 --> 00:29:03,108
<i>Speak roughly to your little boy,
And beat him when he sneezes

205
00:29:03,135 --> 00:29:08,643
<i>He only does it to annoy,
Because he knows it teases

206
00:29:08,743 --> 00:29:13,542
<i>Wow! Wow! Wow!
Wow! Wow! Wow!

207
00:29:13,642 --> 00:29:19,241
<i>He only does it to annoy,
Because he knows it teases

208
00:29:25,541 --> 00:29:28,842
Here! You can nurse it a bit, if you like!

209
00:29:30,541 --> 00:29:34,840
Now, I must go and get ready
to play croquet with the Queen.

210
00:30:03,139 --> 00:30:07,640
Don't grunt! That's not at all a
proper way of expressing yourself.

211
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:11,739
What am I going to do with
this creature when I get it home?

212
00:30:13,639 --> 00:30:15,629
If you're going to turn into a pig, my dear,

213
00:30:15,656 --> 00:30:18,549
I'll have nothing more
to do with you. Mind now!

214
00:30:25,439 --> 00:30:29,738
There's no mistake about
you know, you're a pig!

215
00:30:33,138 --> 00:30:35,676
You would have grown up
to be dreadfully ugly child,

216
00:30:35,703 --> 00:30:37,738
but you do make a handsome pig, I think.

217
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:39,639
<i>Meow...

218
00:30:45,837 --> 00:30:47,637
Why do you grin, oh, cat?

219
00:30:48,138 --> 00:30:51,038
Because I'm a Cheshire cat, that's why.

220
00:30:51,138 --> 00:30:55,538
Well then Cheshire puss, would you tell me,
please, which way I ought to go from here?

221
00:30:56,238 --> 00:30:59,337
That depends a good deal
on where you want to get to?

222
00:30:59,437 --> 00:31:03,538
- I don't care much where.
- Then it doesn't matter which way you go.

223
00:31:03,638 --> 00:31:05,537
So long as I get somewhere.

224
00:31:05,611 --> 00:31:09,718
Oh, you're sure to do that.
If you only walk long enough.

225
00:31:09,837 --> 00:31:11,736
Do you play croquet with the Queen today?

226
00:31:11,837 --> 00:31:15,237
I should like it very much,
but I haven't been invited yet.

227
00:31:15,537 --> 00:31:17,637
You'll see me there.

228
00:31:21,037 --> 00:31:22,437
Must you go so soon?

229
00:31:23,036 --> 00:31:27,936
By the by, what became of the baby?
I'd nearly forgotten to ask.

230
00:31:28,435 --> 00:31:30,135
It turned into a pig.

231
00:31:31,137 --> 00:31:32,436
I thought it would.

232
00:31:45,936 --> 00:31:50,212
- Did you say "pig", or "fig"?
- I said, "pig",

233
00:31:50,239 --> 00:31:53,635
and wish you wouldn't keep
appearing and vanishing so suddenly.

234
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:57,235
- You make on quite giddy.
- All right.

235
00:32:03,035 --> 00:32:05,133
Don't you wish you can do this.

236
00:32:06,634 --> 00:32:11,934
Well, I've often seen a cat without
a grin, but a grin without a cat?

237
00:32:43,434 --> 00:32:46,909
- No room! - No room! - No room!
- No room! - No room! - No room!

238
00:32:46,936 --> 00:32:48,533
There's plenty of room.

239
00:32:52,677 --> 00:32:56,733
- Have some wine?
- I don't see any wine.

240
00:32:57,233 --> 00:32:58,233
There isn't any.

241
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,347
It wasn't very civil of you to offer it.

242
00:33:06,533 --> 00:33:08,232
Your hair needs cutting.

243
00:33:08,432 --> 00:33:11,133
You should not make
personal remarks, it's very rude.

244
00:33:16,932 --> 00:33:20,932
- Why is a raven like a writing desk?
- I believe I can answer that.

245
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:24,695
- Do you mean you can find the answer to it?
- Exactly so.

246
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:28,373
- You should say what you mean.
- What day of the month is it?

247
00:33:28,657 --> 00:33:31,088
- Fourth.
- Ha! Two days wrong!

248
00:33:31,831 --> 00:33:33,831
I told you that butter
wouldn't suit the works!

249
00:33:34,131 --> 00:33:38,131
Oh...
Some crumbs must have got in as well.

250
00:33:39,931 --> 00:33:42,531
Hmm... I put it in with a bread knife.

251
00:33:45,132 --> 00:33:47,431
It was the best butter, you know.

252
00:33:48,631 --> 00:33:50,436
What a funny watch!
<i>It tells the days of the month,

253
00:33:50,463 --> 00:33:52,530
<i>but doesn't
tell what o' clock it is.

254
00:33:52,631 --> 00:33:54,022
Have you guess the riddle yet?

255
00:33:54,049 --> 00:33:57,572
Why... why no, I give it
up, what is the answer?

256
00:33:57,630 --> 00:34:00,330
- I haven't the slightest idea.
- Nor I.

257
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:03,841
I think you might do something
better with time rather than wasting it

258
00:34:03,868 --> 00:34:05,630
asking a lot of riddles
and have no answer.

259
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:09,431
Don't you speak about Time. I dare
say you've never even spoken to him.

260
00:34:09,931 --> 00:34:13,530
- Perhaps not.
- Time and I quarreled last March,

261
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:15,930
Just before he went mad,
you know.

262
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:20,329
It was at a great concert
given by the Queen of Hearts,

263
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:24,590
and I had to sing "Twinkle twinkle
little bat, how I wonder what you're at."

264
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,030
You know the song perhaps?

265
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:29,830
- I've heard something like it.
- It goes on, you know, like this,

266
00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:35,730
<i>Twinkle, twinkle, little bat
How I wonder what you're at</i>

267
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:41,821
<i>Up above the world you fly,
Like a tea-tray in the sky.</i>

268
00:34:41,848 --> 00:34:49,274
<i>Up above the world you fly,
Like a tea-tray in the sky.

269
00:34:49,428 --> 00:34:51,929
<i>Twinkle... twinkle... twinkle... twink...</i>

270
00:34:52,329 --> 00:34:57,529
<i>Twinkle, twinkle, little bat
How I wonder what you're at</i>

271
00:34:57,628 --> 00:35:03,427
<i>Up above the world you fly,
Like a tea-tray in the sky</i>

272
00:35:03,527 --> 00:35:11,428
<i>Up above the world you fly,
Like a tea-tray in the sky</i>

273
00:35:11,528 --> 00:35:14,329
<i>Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle,

274
00:35:14,379 --> 00:35:16,959
<i>twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle,

275
00:35:17,009 --> 00:35:20,554
<i>twinkle, twinkle,
twinkle, twinkle, twinkle,

276
00:35:20,604 --> 00:35:24,226
<i>twinkle, twinkle, twinkle,
twinkle, twinkle...

277
00:35:27,926 --> 00:35:31,526
Well, I'd hardy finished the first
verse when the Queen bawled,

278
00:35:31,727 --> 00:35:33,827
"He's murdering the
Time! Off with his head!"

279
00:35:33,927 --> 00:35:36,428
And ever since that, he
won't do a thing I ask.

280
00:35:36,647 --> 00:35:38,794
It's always six o'clock now.

281
00:35:39,227 --> 00:35:41,526
Oh, is that why all the
tea things are out here?

282
00:35:41,627 --> 00:35:42,627
Yes, that's it.

283
00:35:42,826 --> 00:35:46,726
It's always tea time and we have no
time to wash the tea things in between.

284
00:35:46,927 --> 00:35:48,626
Take some more tea?

285
00:35:49,626 --> 00:35:52,227
I haven't had any yet,
so I can't take more.

286
00:35:52,427 --> 00:35:56,326
You mean you can't take less, it is
very easy to take more than nothing.

287
00:35:56,626 --> 00:35:58,526
I want a clean cup.

288
00:36:16,026 --> 00:36:20,025
It's the stupidest tea party
I ever was at in all my life.

289
00:36:25,525 --> 00:36:28,068
Very curious.

290
00:37:07,523 --> 00:37:11,122
Would you please tell me why
are you painting those roses?

291
00:37:13,623 --> 00:37:15,523
Well, as a matter of fact, Miss,

292
00:37:15,824 --> 00:37:17,984
this tree should have
been a red rose tree

293
00:37:18,011 --> 00:37:19,823
and we put in a
white one by mistake,

294
00:37:20,123 --> 00:37:23,123
and if the Queen should find
out, we'll all have our heads cut off.

295
00:37:23,523 --> 00:37:26,594
So you see, Miss, we're doing our
best before she comes back to paint...

296
00:37:26,623 --> 00:37:30,065
- The Queen! -The Queen! -The Queen!

297
00:37:36,434 --> 00:37:38,928
Come, come, get up!

298
00:37:53,821 --> 00:37:56,321
Her Majesty, the Queen of Hearts!

299
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:14,421
Her Majesty, the Queen!

300
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:18,520
Off with his head!

301
00:38:20,121 --> 00:38:21,521
Off with his head!

302
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,920
What is your name child?

303
00:38:31,319 --> 00:38:33,719
My name is Alice, so please Your Majesty.

304
00:38:33,819 --> 00:38:36,319
Off with her head!
Off with her head!

305
00:38:36,419 --> 00:38:39,019
- Nonsense!
- Off with her head!

306
00:38:39,319 --> 00:38:42,996
- Off with her...
- Consider my dear, she's only a child.

307
00:38:43,023 --> 00:38:46,219
Off with her head!
Off with her head!

308
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:51,808
And besides, this is
the executioners day off.

309
00:38:51,835 --> 00:38:55,434
Oh, it is, is it?
Well, they should lose their heads for this!

310
00:38:55,819 --> 00:38:58,219
- Can you play croquet?
- Yes.

311
00:38:58,418 --> 00:39:01,036
Then, let the game begin at once!

312
00:39:10,918 --> 00:39:15,118
Hurry! Hurry! <i>Hurry! Hurry!
Must I behead you all?

313
00:39:15,918 --> 00:39:18,418
Here, take it. Play.

314
00:39:19,617 --> 00:39:20,818
Off with some heads!

315
00:39:24,019 --> 00:39:26,318
You're pointing the
wrong way for a mallet!

316
00:39:33,017 --> 00:39:35,950
- Pardon me. My back hurts.
- Well!

317
00:39:40,017 --> 00:39:42,617
Don't look at me. I'm
as mixed up as you are!

318
00:39:42,717 --> 00:39:45,717
This game's slowing up.
Off with some heads!

319
00:39:45,817 --> 00:39:47,570
<i>Where are my victims?

320
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:53,017
Search the hedges!
Trash the bushes! Shake the trees!

321
00:40:07,017 --> 00:40:11,616
How glad I am to see you
again, you dear old thing.

322
00:40:12,416 --> 00:40:13,715
How did you like your game?

323
00:40:13,816 --> 00:40:17,616
- Well, it was very exciting.
- Of course it is.

324
00:40:17,716 --> 00:40:22,109
And the moral of that is,
"Be what you would like to be."

325
00:40:22,259 --> 00:40:24,597
Or to put it more simply,

326
00:40:24,824 --> 00:40:26,568
"Never imagine yourself
not to be otherwise"

327
00:40:26,618 --> 00:40:28,698
"than what it might
appear to others that what"

328
00:40:28,725 --> 00:40:30,521
"you were or might have been"

329
00:40:30,548 --> 00:40:32,482
"wasn't otherwise than
what you had been"

330
00:40:32,532 --> 00:40:34,708
"would have appeared to
them to be otherwise."

331
00:40:35,915 --> 00:40:38,615
I should understand that
better if it were written down.

332
00:40:39,015 --> 00:40:41,114
I can't quite follow it as you say it.

333
00:40:41,514 --> 00:40:44,914
Oh, that's nothing to
what I could say, if I chose.

334
00:40:45,514 --> 00:40:47,414
And the moral of that is...

335
00:40:51,215 --> 00:40:53,101
It's a fine day, Your Majesty.

336
00:40:55,915 --> 00:41:01,141
I give you fair warning.
Either you or your head must be off at once!

337
00:41:10,614 --> 00:41:13,614
Please Your Majesty,
could you make it go away?

338
00:41:13,814 --> 00:41:16,914
Queen! Queen!
Where are you Queen?

339
00:41:22,513 --> 00:41:26,014
- What fun! - What is the fun? - The queen!

340
00:41:26,113 --> 00:41:29,213
They never really executes
anybody she condemns, you know.

341
00:41:29,646 --> 00:41:34,371
The King...
the King pardons everybody.

342
00:41:34,914 --> 00:41:37,825
I'm very happy to know that, I'm sure.

343
00:41:40,612 --> 00:41:42,712
Have you seen Mock Turtle yet?

344
00:41:42,813 --> 00:41:47,612
Why... why, no. I don't even
know what a Mock Turtle is.

345
00:41:47,862 --> 00:41:50,515
It's what mock turtle
soup's made from.

346
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:57,413
Come here will you,
Mock Turtle, old thing.

347
00:42:04,412 --> 00:42:08,211
- What is his sorrow?
- It's all his fancy.

348
00:42:09,011 --> 00:42:13,911
- He hasn't got no sorrow.
- No sorrow indeed...

349
00:42:16,111 --> 00:42:18,869
Mine are the sorrows
of a sorrowful sorrow.

350
00:42:19,111 --> 00:42:22,711
Mine are the woes of a woeful woe.
Mine are the...

351
00:42:22,744 --> 00:42:27,536
This here young lady,
she wants for to know your history, she do.

352
00:42:30,811 --> 00:42:32,711
I'll tell it her.

353
00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:35,802
Sit down both of you,

354
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:38,330
but don't speak a word
till I've finished.

355
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:46,210
Once, I was a real turtle.

356
00:42:47,609 --> 00:42:49,480
Oh, dear!

357
00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:51,109
Oh, dear!

358
00:42:51,209 --> 00:42:56,005
When we were little,
we went to school in the sea.

359
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:58,949
The Master was an old turtle.

360
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:01,610
We use to call him Tortoise.

361
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:04,188
Why did you call him
Tortoise, if he wasn't one?

362
00:43:04,309 --> 00:43:06,209
We called him Tortoise
because he taught us.

363
00:43:06,309 --> 00:43:09,109
You ought to be ashamed of yourself
for asking such a simple question.

364
00:43:09,209 --> 00:43:12,883
We went to school in the sea,
though you mayn't believe it.

365
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:14,199
I never said I didn't.

366
00:43:14,306 --> 00:43:16,509
- You did.
- Hold your tongue!

367
00:43:16,608 --> 00:43:19,202
We had the best of educations.

368
00:43:19,908 --> 00:43:22,709
In fact, we went to school every day.

369
00:43:23,009 --> 00:43:26,709
I've been to a day school, too.
We learned French and music.

370
00:43:26,909 --> 00:43:30,283
- I only took the regular course.
- What was that?

371
00:43:30,310 --> 00:43:33,575
Reeling and writhing to begin with.

372
00:43:34,007 --> 00:43:37,007
And then the different
branches of arithmetic,

373
00:43:37,308 --> 00:43:43,826
ambition, distraction,
uglification and derision.

374
00:43:43,907 --> 00:43:46,408
And how many hours a
day did you do lessons?

375
00:43:46,607 --> 00:43:51,307
Ten hours the first day
and nine the next and so on.

376
00:43:51,407 --> 00:43:55,807
That's why they're called lessons,
because they lessen from day to day.

377
00:43:56,507 --> 00:43:59,307
Then the eleventh day
must have been a holiday?

378
00:44:00,107 --> 00:44:03,607
- <i>Of course.</i>
- And how did you manage on the twelfth day?

379
00:44:06,117 --> 00:44:09,475
Oh well, that's enough about lessons.

380
00:44:10,007 --> 00:44:12,006
Shall we play games...

381
00:44:12,507 --> 00:44:15,170
or shall the Mock Turtle sing?

382
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:19,506
Oh, a song please, if the
Mock Turtle would be so kind.

383
00:44:20,406 --> 00:44:22,806
No accounting for tastes.

384
00:44:23,206 --> 00:44:25,707
Sing her "Turtle Soup",
will you, old fellow?

385
00:44:26,157 --> 00:44:28,880
In a moment...

386
00:44:33,306 --> 00:44:42,263
<i>Beautiful soup Who cares for
fish, Game, or any other dish?</i>

387
00:44:42,305 --> 00:44:49,906
<i>Who would not give all else for two
Pennyworth only of beautiful soup?</i>

388
00:44:49,981 --> 00:44:57,690
<i>Pennyworth only of beautiful soup,
beautiful soup, beautiful soup.</i>

389
00:44:57,717 --> 00:45:04,141
<i>Soup of the evening,
beautiful soup.</i>

390
00:45:04,902 --> 00:45:10,704
<i>Beautiful, beau...</i>

391
00:45:36,803 --> 00:45:38,803
Faster! Faster!

392
00:45:39,103 --> 00:45:43,602
Faster! Faster! Faster! Much faster!

393
00:45:43,702 --> 00:45:45,945
- Are we nearly there?
- Nearly there?

394
00:45:46,003 --> 00:45:48,202
Why,  we past it 10 minutes ago.

395
00:45:48,603 --> 00:45:50,403
Faster!

396
00:45:54,702 --> 00:45:56,688
It's all marked out like a chessboard.

397
00:45:56,715 --> 00:45:58,357
Of course its a chessboard,

398
00:45:58,402 --> 00:46:02,503
life is a chessboard, and
you are a Queen's pawn.

399
00:46:03,002 --> 00:46:08,102
You will go immediately to the fourth square,
which you should reach in exactly no time.

400
00:46:08,359 --> 00:46:12,920
- Did you remark something?
- I didn't know had to make one just then.

401
00:46:12,947 --> 00:46:17,402
You should have told me how
kind it is of me to tell you all this.

402
00:46:19,202 --> 00:46:22,961
No questions? Very well, then, no answers.

403
00:46:23,011 --> 00:46:26,207
Open your mouth wide when you speak,

404
00:46:26,234 --> 00:46:31,763
and always speak in French if you
can't think of the English for something.

405
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:40,300
Turn out your toes as you walk and
always say "Your Majesty", and so forth.

406
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:13,107
If you think we are waxworks,
you ought to pay, you know.

407
00:47:13,399 --> 00:47:18,023
Wax works weren't made to be
looked at for nothing. No how.

408
00:47:19,099 --> 00:47:22,999
Contrary-wise, if you think
we're alive, you ought to speak.

409
00:47:24,399 --> 00:47:26,200
I'm sure I'm very sorry.

410
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:30,099
I was wondering which is the best way out
of this wood. Would you tell me please?

411
00:47:34,397 --> 00:47:38,498
You've begun wrong.
The first thing in a visit is to say,

412
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,726
"How do you do?" And shake hands.

413
00:48:10,197 --> 00:48:12,397
I hope you're not much tired.

414
00:48:14,096 --> 00:48:16,496
Why, no how,
but thank you very much for asking.

415
00:48:16,771 --> 00:48:19,797
So much obliged.
You like poetry?

416
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:22,998
Yes, pretty well. Some poetry.

417
00:48:23,897 --> 00:48:28,196
But, would you tell me first which
road leads out of the woods?

418
00:48:31,396 --> 00:48:32,855
What shall I repeat to her?

419
00:48:33,796 --> 00:48:36,212
The Walrus and the
Carpenter is the longest.

420
00:48:38,897 --> 00:48:42,296
<i>The sun was shining on the
sea  Shining with all his might</i>

421
00:48:42,396 --> 00:48:46,272
<i>He did his very best to make
The billows smooth and bright</i>

422
00:48:46,996 --> 00:48:51,296
<i>And this was odd, because
it was The middle of the night</i>

423
00:48:58,695 --> 00:49:01,995
<i>The Walrus and the Carpenter
Were walking close at hand</i>

424
00:49:02,095 --> 00:49:06,196
<i>They wept like anything to
see Such quantities of sand</i>

425
00:49:06,227 --> 00:49:09,683
<i>If this were only cleared away,
they said, it would be grand</i>

426
00:49:09,710 --> 00:49:13,420
<i>If seven maids with seven
mops Swept it for half a year</i>

427
00:49:13,447 --> 00:49:17,353
<i>Do you suppose, the Walrus
said That they could get it clear?</i>

428
00:49:17,394 --> 00:49:20,994
<i>I doubt it, said the Carpenter
And shed a bitter tear</i>

429
00:49:25,495 --> 00:49:29,545
<i>Oh,  oyster come and walk
with us The Walrus did beseech</i>

430
00:49:29,572 --> 00:49:33,219
<i>A pleasant walk, a pleasant
talk Along the briny beach</i>

431
00:49:33,395 --> 00:49:37,094
<i>They could not do with more than
four To give a hand to each</i>

432
00:49:45,593 --> 00:49:49,361
<i>The eldest Oyster looked at
him But never a word he said</i>

433
00:49:49,494 --> 00:49:52,993
<i>The eldest Oyster winked his
eye And shook his heavy head</i>

434
00:49:53,193 --> 00:49:57,061
<i>Meaning to say he did not
choose To leave the oyster bed</i>

435
00:49:58,892 --> 00:50:02,574
<i>But younger oysters hurried
up, All eager for the treat</i>

436
00:50:02,601 --> 00:50:06,293
<i>Their coats were brushed Their faces
washed Their shoes were clean and neat</i>

437
00:50:06,394 --> 00:50:10,293
<i>And this was odd, because,
you know, They hadn't any feet</i>

438
00:50:26,892 --> 00:50:30,560
<i>The time has come, the Walrus
said, To talk of many things</i>

439
00:50:30,592 --> 00:50:34,490
<i>Of shoes and ships and
sealing wax Of cabbages and kings</i>

440
00:50:34,517 --> 00:50:38,085
<i>And why the sea is boiling hot
And whether pigs have wings</i>

441
00:50:38,112 --> 00:50:42,127
<i>A loaf of bread, the Walrus
said Is what we chiefly need</i>

442
00:50:42,154 --> 00:50:45,739
<i>Pepper and vinegar besides
Are very good indeed</i>

443
00:50:45,766 --> 00:50:49,418
<i>Now if you're ready, Oysters
dear We can begin to feed</i>

444
00:50:49,445 --> 00:50:53,322
<i>But not on us, the Oysters
cried Turning a little blue</i>

445
00:50:53,349 --> 00:50:56,991
<i>After such kindness  that
would be A dismal thing to do</i>

446
00:50:57,190 --> 00:51:00,690
<i>The night is fine, the Walrus
said Do you admire the view?</i>

447
00:51:29,089 --> 00:51:32,664
<i>I weep for you, the Walrus
said I deeply sympathize</i>

448
00:51:32,691 --> 00:51:36,737
<i>With sobs and tears he sorted
out Those of the largest size</i>

449
00:51:36,764 --> 00:51:40,240
<i>Holding his pocket handkerchief
Before his streaming eyes</i>

450
00:51:40,267 --> 00:51:43,847
<i>Oh oyster, said the Carpenter,
You've had a pleasant run</i>

451
00:51:43,889 --> 00:51:47,688
<i>Shall we be trotting home again?
But answer came there none</i>

452
00:51:47,789 --> 00:51:51,388
<i>And this was scarcely odd
because They'd eaten every one</i>

453
00:51:58,289 --> 00:52:01,377
Well! They were both
very unpleasant characters.

454
00:52:01,588 --> 00:52:03,880
But at any rate I'd better
be leaving the wood,

455
00:52:03,930 --> 00:52:05,873
because it's really
getting very dark.

456
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:11,288
- Well, Goodbye.
- Look! Do you see that?

457
00:52:12,487 --> 00:52:14,864
<i>- It's only a rattle.</i>
- No!

458
00:52:14,891 --> 00:52:17,988
Only an old rattle,
quite old and broken.

459
00:52:18,487 --> 00:52:22,387
<i>I knew it was.
It's spoiled, of course.

460
00:52:31,887 --> 00:52:34,987
My nice new rattle.

461
00:52:39,088 --> 00:52:41,846
Of course you agree to have a battle?

462
00:52:44,486 --> 00:52:45,720
I suppose so.

463
00:52:46,786 --> 00:52:49,658
Only she must help us
to dress up, you know.

464
00:52:52,386 --> 00:52:57,487
Of course! <i>Tweedledee and
Tweedledum Agreed to have a battle</i>

465
00:52:57,587 --> 00:53:01,486
<i>For Tweedledee said Tweedledum
Had spoiled his nice new rattle</i>

466
00:53:01,586 --> 00:53:05,385
<i>Just then down flew a monstrous
crow As black as a tar-barrel</i>

467
00:53:05,461 --> 00:53:10,094
<i>Which frightened both the heroes
so They quite forgot their quarrel.</i>

468
00:53:11,385 --> 00:53:14,042
I hope you're a good at
pinning and tying string.

469
00:53:14,069 --> 00:53:16,684
All this is gotta go on,
somehow or other.

470
00:53:18,485 --> 00:53:20,786
This is to keep my head
from being cut off,

471
00:53:21,186 --> 00:53:22,656
You know one of the most
serious things that can

472
00:53:22,729 --> 00:53:25,485
happen to one in a battle is
to get one's head cut off.

473
00:53:26,252 --> 00:53:30,185
- Do I look very pale?
- Well, yes a little.

474
00:53:30,485 --> 00:53:37,385
I... I'm very brave generally,
only today I happen to have a headache.

475
00:53:37,418 --> 00:53:41,219
Well, I've got a toothache.
I'm far worse than you.

476
00:53:41,985 --> 00:53:44,084
Then you'd both better
not fight today.

477
00:53:44,484 --> 00:53:46,858
Oh, we must have a bit of a fight.

478
00:53:46,885 --> 00:53:49,191
Let's fight till 6:00
and then have dinner.

479
00:53:49,218 --> 00:53:52,584
There's only one sword, but you
can have the umbrella. It's sharper.

480
00:53:55,784 --> 00:53:58,675
Only we must begin quick.
It's getting very, very dark.

481
00:53:58,983 --> 00:54:01,084
And darker and darker.

482
00:54:03,285 --> 00:54:07,183
What a thick black cloud
that is, and how fast it comes.

483
00:54:07,783 --> 00:54:09,984
Why, I do believe it's got wings.

484
00:54:10,083 --> 00:54:12,682
- It's the crow!
- Crow!

485
00:54:45,582 --> 00:54:47,451
May I put your shawl straight for you?

486
00:54:47,478 --> 00:54:52,029
I don't know what's the matter with it.
It's out of temper, I think.

487
00:54:52,056 --> 00:54:56,756
I've pinned it here, and I've pinned
it there, but there's no pleasing it.

488
00:54:57,081 --> 00:55:00,481
It can't go on straight, you
know, if you put all the pins on one side.

489
00:55:01,781 --> 00:55:05,717
And, dear me,
what a state your hair is in.

490
00:55:05,881 --> 00:55:10,980
Oh, the brush has got...
entangled in it.

491
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:13,881
And I lost the comb yesterday.

492
00:55:14,681 --> 00:55:17,798
There... now you look better!

493
00:55:20,094 --> 00:55:21,722
My finger's bleeding.

494
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:27,280
What's the matter? Have
you pricked your finger?

495
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:30,180
I haven't pricked it
yet, but I soon shall.

496
00:55:30,230 --> 00:55:31,630
When do you expect to do it?

497
00:55:32,013 --> 00:55:35,922
Oh, when I fasten my shawl again,
the broach will come undone.

498
00:55:36,379 --> 00:55:38,407
Watch out,
you're holding it all wrong.

499
00:55:40,198 --> 00:55:42,922
Now you understand the
way things happen here.

500
00:55:43,279 --> 00:55:44,679
But why don't you scream now?

501
00:55:45,279 --> 00:55:47,761
Why, I've done all the screaming already.

502
00:55:47,788 --> 00:55:50,297
Now, what would be the
good of doing it all over again?

503
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:54,878
I suppose so.
Well, it's a bit lighter now.

504
00:55:55,079 --> 00:55:57,370
I'm glad that crow is gone.

505
00:55:58,087 --> 00:55:59,921
I hope your finger's better now?

506
00:55:59,979 --> 00:56:01,078
Much better.

507
00:56:02,279 --> 00:56:07,678
Better, better, better.

508
00:56:08,579 --> 00:56:13,509
Bah... bah...

509
00:56:16,978 --> 00:56:21,678
- What is it you want to buy?
- I should like to buy an egg, please.

510
00:56:29,478 --> 00:56:32,545
I never put things
into people's hands.

511
00:56:34,178 --> 00:56:36,593
That would never do.

512
00:56:37,877 --> 00:56:40,078
You get it for yourself.

513
00:56:41,878 --> 00:56:43,787
What a strange egg.

514
00:56:44,577 --> 00:56:46,977
<i>I keeps growing much
faster than it should!

515
00:56:47,577 --> 00:56:49,984
Curiouser and curiouser!

516
00:56:50,977 --> 00:56:53,477
<i>It's bigger than a chicken!

517
00:56:54,777 --> 00:56:58,467
<i>Why, it... it's Humpty-Dumpty!

518
00:56:58,677 --> 00:57:01,642
Don't stand there staring
at me as if I were an egg.

519
00:57:01,749 --> 00:57:04,383
Tell me your name and your business.

520
00:57:04,532 --> 00:57:05,851
My name is Alice.

521
00:57:05,878 --> 00:57:08,000
It's a stupid enough
name. What does it mean?

522
00:57:08,075 --> 00:57:09,562
Must a name mean something?

523
00:57:09,589 --> 00:57:13,156
Of course it must, my
name means the shape I am...

524
00:57:13,576 --> 00:57:15,576
and a right handsome shape it is.

525
00:57:16,376 --> 00:57:19,424
With your name,
you might be any shape.

526
00:57:21,075 --> 00:57:25,017
- Why do you sit out here all alone?
- Because there's nobody with me.

527
00:57:25,067 --> 00:57:28,257
Did you think I couldn't answer that?
Ask another.

528
00:57:28,775 --> 00:57:30,875
Don't you think you'd
be safer on the ground?

529
00:57:30,975 --> 00:57:32,974
That wall is so very narrow.

530
00:57:33,075 --> 00:57:37,001
Of course I don't think so.
Why, if ever I did fall off,

531
00:57:37,776 --> 00:57:39,476
which there's no chance of,

532
00:57:39,975 --> 00:57:41,575
but if I did,

533
00:57:42,575 --> 00:57:46,264
If I did fall,
the King has promised me...

534
00:57:46,291 --> 00:57:48,457
To send all his horses
and all his men.

535
00:57:48,574 --> 00:57:52,133
Ah, so you know.
All his horses and all his men.

536
00:57:52,627 --> 00:57:54,947
They'd pick me up again
in a minute, they would.

537
00:57:54,997 --> 00:57:57,975
However, this conversation
is going on a little too fast.

538
00:57:58,075 --> 00:58:00,274
Let's go back to the
last remark but one.

539
00:58:00,574 --> 00:58:02,625
I'm afraid I can't quite remember it.

540
00:58:02,674 --> 00:58:06,774
Ah, in that case we start afresh, and
it's my turn to choose a subject.

541
00:58:06,974 --> 00:58:09,002
How old did you say you were?

542
00:58:09,873 --> 00:58:11,584
Twelve years and four months.

543
00:58:11,673 --> 00:58:13,956
Wrong. You never said a word like it.

544
00:58:14,473 --> 00:58:16,506
I though you meant "How old are you?"

545
00:58:16,574 --> 00:58:18,836
If I'd meant that,
I'd have said that.

546
00:58:19,974 --> 00:58:23,773
Twelve years and four months.
An uncomfortable sort of age.

547
00:58:24,073 --> 00:58:28,647
Now my advice, would have been to leave
off at twelve, but it's too late now.

548
00:58:29,773 --> 00:58:32,080
What a beautiful belt.

549
00:58:33,873 --> 00:58:35,638
Or is it a beautiful collar?

550
00:58:35,665 --> 00:58:39,624
It is a most provoking thing when
a person doesn't know a collar from a belt.

551
00:58:40,073 --> 00:58:42,264
I know it's very ignorant of me.

552
00:58:42,573 --> 00:58:45,772
It's a collar, child, and a
beautiful one, as you say.

553
00:58:46,172 --> 00:58:48,066
It's a present from the
White King and Queen.

554
00:58:48,093 --> 00:58:49,402
Is it really?

555
00:58:49,472 --> 00:58:51,772
They gave it me,
for an un-birthday present.

556
00:58:51,873 --> 00:58:52,973
I beg your pardon?

557
00:58:53,072 --> 00:58:56,397
I'm not offended, and it
isn't respectable to beg.

558
00:58:56,572 --> 00:58:59,115
I mean, what is an un-birthday present?

559
00:58:59,172 --> 00:59:02,680
A present given when it
isn't your birthday, of course.

560
00:59:02,773 --> 00:59:04,429
I like birthday presents best.

561
00:59:04,456 --> 00:59:06,070
You don't know what
you're talking about.

562
00:59:06,372 --> 00:59:08,372
How many days are there in a year?

563
00:59:08,414 --> 00:59:10,098
Three hundred and sixty-five.

564
00:59:10,125 --> 00:59:12,709
- And how many birthdays have you?
- One.

565
00:59:12,871 --> 00:59:16,469
And if you take from 365, what remains?

566
00:59:16,496 --> 00:59:18,190
Three hundred and sixty-four, of course.

567
00:59:18,217 --> 00:59:21,322
Well then, there are three
hundred and sixty-four days

568
00:59:21,372 --> 00:59:23,774
when you might get
un-birthday presents.

569
00:59:23,801 --> 00:59:24,496
Certainly.

570
00:59:24,572 --> 00:59:28,570
And only one for birthday presents.
There's glory for you!

571
00:59:29,170 --> 00:59:31,371
I don't know what you mean by "glory".

572
00:59:31,471 --> 00:59:33,471
Of course you don't, till I tell you.

573
00:59:33,671 --> 00:59:36,670
I meant there's a nice
knock-down argument for you.

574
00:59:37,170 --> 00:59:38,769
But "glory" doesn't mean that.

575
00:59:38,870 --> 00:59:42,170
When I use a word, it means
just what I choose it to mean,

576
00:59:42,671 --> 00:59:44,170
neither more or less.

577
00:59:44,771 --> 00:59:48,070
The question is whether you can
make words mean different things.

578
00:59:48,271 --> 00:59:53,170
The question is, which is to be
master, you or the word? That's all.

579
00:59:53,370 --> 00:59:55,651
<i>However, I can manage the whole lot.

580
00:59:55,871 --> 00:59:58,953
Impenetrability, that's what I say.

581
00:59:59,070 --> 01:00:01,412
Would you tell me,
please, what that means?

582
01:00:01,569 --> 01:00:05,152
I meant by impenetrability that
we've had enough of the subject,

583
01:00:05,179 --> 01:00:08,973
and it would be just as well if you would
mention what you mean to do next,

584
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,869
as I suppose you don't mean to
stop here all the rest of your life.

585
01:00:12,368 --> 01:00:16,867
Fancy it meaning all that. You seem
very clever at explaining words, Sir.

586
01:00:16,969 --> 01:00:20,668
Would you kindly tell me the meaning
of a poem called Jabberwocky?

587
01:00:20,743 --> 01:00:24,568
- I read it a long time ago.
- I can, but I won't. That's all. Goodbye.

588
01:00:25,169 --> 01:00:26,744
Goodbye, till we meet again.

589
01:00:26,968 --> 01:00:30,969
I shouldn't know you if we did
meet, you're so exactly like other people.

590
01:00:31,069 --> 01:00:33,369
The face is what one generally goes by.

591
01:00:33,768 --> 01:00:36,568
That's just it. Your face is
the same as everybody's.

592
01:00:36,668 --> 01:00:41,968
The two eyes, so. Nose in
the middle, mouth under.

593
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:45,447
Now if your  two eyes were
on the same side of the nose,

594
01:00:45,968 --> 01:00:48,982
or the mouth on the top,
that would be some help.

595
01:00:49,568 --> 01:00:52,285
- It wouldn't look nice.
- Wait till you've tried.

596
01:00:53,867 --> 01:00:55,067
Watch out!

597
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:57,353
Help! Help! I'm falling! Tell the King!

598
01:00:57,429 --> 01:01:00,535
Tell him to bring his
horses and his men! Help!

599
01:01:20,666 --> 01:01:21,766
What's happened?

600
01:01:22,766 --> 01:01:25,028
We ran into each other, Your Majesty.

601
01:01:25,067 --> 01:01:28,440
Good. I rather fancied
something like that had happened.

602
01:01:28,490 --> 01:01:31,199
Oh, Your Majesty,
Humpty-Dumpty fell off the wall.

603
01:01:31,367 --> 01:01:36,282
I know, I know. Four thousand two hundred
and seven of my soldiers are on the way.

604
01:01:36,332 --> 01:01:37,702
Two without horses!

605
01:01:42,465 --> 01:01:47,465
If all this King's horses and men can't
put him back together again, nobody can.

606
01:01:56,066 --> 01:01:58,665
I'm glad Humpty will be
all right. I was worried.

607
01:01:58,841 --> 01:01:59,885
Well, don't be.

608
01:02:00,163 --> 01:02:05,364
Look along the road, and tell me if you
can see either of my three messengers.

609
01:02:08,658 --> 01:02:10,274
I see nobody on the road.

610
01:02:10,524 --> 01:02:14,052
Oh, I only wish I had such eyes.

611
01:02:14,102 --> 01:02:18,364
To be able to see nobody,
and at that distance.

612
01:02:44,063 --> 01:02:47,363
Oh! It's too, too bad.

613
01:03:08,662 --> 01:03:09,808
Can I help you, Sir?

614
01:03:09,852 --> 01:03:12,551
- On or off?
- You are on.

615
01:03:12,761 --> 01:03:17,062
- Oh, in a short time I shall be off again.
- I'm so sorry.

616
01:03:17,662 --> 01:03:19,663
Are you the King's messenger?

617
01:03:19,963 --> 01:03:21,763
I'm the White Knight.

618
01:03:24,162 --> 01:03:26,161
I see you're admiring my little box.

619
01:03:26,861 --> 01:03:28,461
It's my own invention, to keep...

620
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:31,319
to keep clothes and sandwiches in.

621
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:35,461
You see, I carry it upside down
so... so the rain can't come in.

622
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:39,661
But the things can get out.
Do you know the lid is open?

623
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:47,661
Then if all the things must have fallen
out, the box is no use without them.

624
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:04,247
- Can you guess why I did that?
- I can't imagine.

625
01:04:04,660 --> 01:04:08,560
In hopes some bees may make a nest in it.
Then I should get the honey.

626
01:04:09,259 --> 01:04:12,659
But you've got a <i>beehive, or
something like one, fastened to the saddle.

627
01:04:13,259 --> 01:04:15,960
It's a very good beehive
too, one of the best kind,

628
01:04:16,659 --> 01:04:19,868
but not a single bee
has come near it yet.

629
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:21,460
That other thing's a mousetrap.

630
01:04:22,660 --> 01:04:27,301
I suppose the mice keep the bees out or the
bees keep the mice out. I don't know which.

631
01:04:27,958 --> 01:04:31,058
It isn't very likely there would
be any mice on the horse's back.

632
01:04:31,085 --> 01:04:32,558
Not very likely, perhaps,

633
01:04:33,158 --> 01:04:35,678
but I don't choose to have
them running all about.

634
01:04:36,459 --> 01:04:39,358
You see,
I'm well provided for everything.

635
01:04:39,858 --> 01:04:42,706
That's the reason the horse has
all those anklets round his feet.

636
01:04:43,659 --> 01:04:44,859
<i>What are they for?

637
01:04:45,759 --> 01:04:50,183
To guard against the bites of sharks.
It's my own invention.

638
01:04:52,058 --> 01:04:55,242
But let's go on, I'll go with
you to the edge of the woods.

639
01:05:03,159 --> 01:05:05,658
I hope you've got your
hair well-fastened on.

640
01:05:06,258 --> 01:05:09,910
- Only the usual way.
- That's hardly enough.

641
01:05:10,057 --> 01:05:14,557
You see, the wind is so strong here.
It's strong as soup.

642
01:05:15,857 --> 01:05:19,056
Have you invented a plan for
keeping the hair from being blown off?

643
01:05:19,656 --> 01:05:23,733
Not yet. But I have a plan for
keeping the hair from falling off.

644
01:05:24,257 --> 01:05:26,101
I should like to hear it, very much.

645
01:05:27,357 --> 01:05:32,600
First, you take an upright stick, then you
make your hair creep up it like a wine.

646
01:05:33,457 --> 01:05:37,256
Now the reason hair falls off
is because it hangs down.

647
01:05:38,256 --> 01:05:40,305
Things never fall upwards, you know.

648
01:05:40,857 --> 01:05:42,753
It's my own invention.

649
01:05:43,256 --> 01:05:45,258
You may try it if you like.

650
01:06:00,755 --> 01:06:02,655
I'm a great hand at inventing things.

651
01:06:03,067 --> 01:06:05,869
Now, I daresay you noticed,
that last time you picked me up,

652
01:06:05,919 --> 01:06:09,358
- I was looking rather thoughtful.
- You were a little grave.

653
01:06:09,755 --> 01:06:13,402
Well, just then I was inventing a
new way of getting over a gate.

654
01:06:13,656 --> 01:06:16,753
- Would you like to hear it?
- Very much indeed.

655
01:06:17,754 --> 01:06:19,954
Well, I'll tell you how
I came to think of it.

656
01:06:20,454 --> 01:06:21,454
I said to myself,

657
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:25,674
"The only difficulty is with the feet.
The head's high enough already."

658
01:06:26,154 --> 01:06:30,475
Now, first I put my head on the top of
the gate, then my head's high enough,

659
01:06:31,355 --> 01:06:35,854
then I stand on my head, then my
feet are high enough. Then I'm over.

660
01:06:37,655 --> 01:06:39,217
Sir Knight!

661
01:06:47,253 --> 01:06:51,754
If there were only a gate down here,
I'd be in excellent position to cross it.

662
01:06:51,855 --> 01:06:55,487
How can you go on talking so
quietly with your head in a ditch?

663
01:06:55,754 --> 01:06:57,753
What does it matter where
my body happens to be?

664
01:06:57,864 --> 01:07:00,253
My mind goes on working all the same.

665
01:07:00,452 --> 01:07:04,333
In fact, I once invented a new
pudding during the meat course.

666
01:07:04,653 --> 01:07:06,868
In time to have it cooked
for the next course?

667
01:07:07,534 --> 01:07:09,486
That was quick work.

668
01:07:09,753 --> 01:07:11,536
Well, not the next course.

669
01:07:11,586 --> 01:07:15,397
In fact, I don't believe that
pudding ever was cooked.

670
01:07:15,452 --> 01:07:17,222
What did you mean it to be made of?

671
01:07:18,056 --> 01:07:22,589
- Well, it began with blotting paper.
- That wouldn't be very nice, I'm afraid.

672
01:07:22,616 --> 01:07:27,205
Not very nice alone, but imagine how good
would it be to be mixed with other things,

673
01:07:27,251 --> 01:07:30,416
such as gunpowder and sealing wax.

674
01:07:31,964 --> 01:07:35,667
And here I must leave you.
This is the end of the wood.

675
01:07:36,452 --> 01:07:38,052
You've only a few yards to go.

676
01:07:38,152 --> 01:07:43,057
<i>Down the hill, across that little brook,
and then you'll be a queen.

677
01:07:43,451 --> 01:07:44,951
At last.

678
01:07:45,751 --> 01:07:50,208
But you'll stay and see me off first?
I shan't be long. You'll wait?

679
01:07:50,251 --> 01:07:53,798
- Of course I'll wait.
- I think it'll encourage me.

680
01:07:54,151 --> 01:07:56,752
Thank you very much for
coming so far out of your way.

681
01:07:57,351 --> 01:08:01,350
For that, I shall expect you
to cry a good deal as I go.

682
01:08:32,350 --> 01:08:37,426
The poor, dear Knight,
he's the nicest person yet.

683
01:09:00,349 --> 01:09:02,189
Well, here I am.

684
01:09:07,248 --> 01:09:08,748
What's this?

685
01:09:15,548 --> 01:09:19,225
A crown!
A golden crown!

686
01:09:22,147 --> 01:09:23,748
I'm a Queen!
I'm a Queen!

687
01:09:23,848 --> 01:09:28,621
<i>How dare you say that you're a Queen?
What right have you to call yourself so?

688
01:09:29,055 --> 01:09:33,486
You can't be a Queen, you know,
till you've passed the proper examination,

689
01:09:33,536 --> 01:09:36,246
and the sooner we begin it, the better.

690
01:09:36,447 --> 01:09:37,804
Be seated.

691
01:09:41,663 --> 01:09:43,354
Yes, Your Majesty.

692
01:09:50,246 --> 01:09:52,897
- I'm ready Your Majesties.
- Can you do addition?

693
01:09:52,947 --> 01:09:57,247
Now, what's one and one and one and one and
one and one and one and one and one and one?

694
01:09:57,746 --> 01:10:00,848
- I don't know. I lost count.
- She can't do addition.

695
01:10:01,047 --> 01:10:04,946
Can you answer any useful
questions? How is bread made?

696
01:10:05,146 --> 01:10:06,996
I know that.
You take some flour...

697
01:10:07,023 --> 01:10:09,663
Where do you pick the flower,
in a garden or in the hedges?

698
01:10:10,245 --> 01:10:12,399
It isn't picked at all, it's ground.

699
01:10:12,446 --> 01:10:16,845
But how many acres of ground? I wish
you wouldn't leave out so many things!

700
01:10:16,911 --> 01:10:19,545
- Oh dear!
- You know any Languages?

701
01:10:19,645 --> 01:10:22,098
What's the French for "fiddle-de-dee"?

702
01:10:22,246 --> 01:10:25,546
- Fiddle-de-dee's not English.
- Who ever said it was?

703
01:10:25,645 --> 01:10:28,256
Well, if you'll tell me what language
"fiddle-de-dee" is,

704
01:10:28,306 --> 01:10:29,845
I'll tell you the French for it.

705
01:10:29,945 --> 01:10:32,045
Queens never make bargains.

706
01:10:33,145 --> 01:10:34,944
I'm so sleepy.

707
01:10:35,544 --> 01:10:38,543
Ah, she's tired, poor thing.

708
01:10:39,543 --> 01:10:41,745
So smooth her hair,

709
01:10:42,844 --> 01:10:48,044
lend her your nightcap and
sing her a soothing lullaby.

710
01:10:48,645 --> 01:10:52,360
I haven't any nightcap, and I
don't know any soothing lullabies.

711
01:10:52,544 --> 01:10:54,844
I'll have to do it myself.

712
01:10:54,945 --> 01:10:58,444
<i>Hush-a-bye lady, in Alice's lap</i>

713
01:10:58,844 --> 01:11:02,943
<i>When the feast's ready,
we've time for a nap</i>

714
01:11:03,143 --> 01:11:07,543
<i>When the feast's over
we'll go to the ball</i>

715
01:11:07,643 --> 01:11:13,643
<i>Red Queen and White
Queen and Alice and all</i>

716
01:11:14,443 --> 01:11:17,355
Now that you know the
words, sing it through to me.

717
01:11:17,643 --> 01:11:20,543
I'm sleepy, too.

718
01:11:23,443 --> 01:11:24,972
Now what am I to do?

719
01:11:25,042 --> 01:11:29,143
- Do wake up.
-<i>To the looking-glass world

720
01:11:29,268 --> 01:11:34,143
<i>It was Alice that said,</i>

721
01:11:34,442 --> 01:11:38,842
<i>"I've a scepter in hand"</i>

722
01:11:38,942 --> 01:11:43,342
<i>"I've a crown on my head"</i>

723
01:11:43,598 --> 01:11:48,483
- <i>Let the Looking Glass...</i>
- No admittance until week after next.

724
01:11:48,642 --> 01:11:50,603
Why... why, how dare you!

725
01:11:54,442 --> 01:11:57,621
<i>Fill up the glasses
as quick as you can</i>

726
01:11:57,648 --> 01:12:01,064
<i>And sprinkle the table
with buttons and bran</i>

727
01:12:01,091 --> 01:12:04,534
<i>Put cats in the coffee,
and mice in the tea</i>

728
01:12:04,561 --> 01:12:08,335
<i>And welcome Queen
Alice with 30 times three</i>

729
01:12:08,362 --> 01:12:12,122
<i>Put cats in the coffee,
and mice in the tea</i>

730
01:12:12,149 --> 01:12:16,841
<i>And welcome Queen
Alice with 30 times three</i>

731
01:12:21,140 --> 01:12:25,646
<i>Then put in the glasses,
molasses and ink</i>

732
01:12:25,673 --> 01:12:29,047
<i>And anything else
that is pleasant to drink</i>

733
01:12:29,074 --> 01:12:32,828
<i>Mix sand with the cider
And wool with the wine</i>

734
01:12:32,855 --> 01:12:36,737
<i>And welcome Queen
Alice with 90 times nine</i>

735
01:12:36,764 --> 01:12:40,621
<i>Mix sand with the cider,
And wool with the wine</i>

736
01:12:40,648 --> 01:12:49,992
<i>And welcome Queen Alice with 90 times
90 times 90 times nine</i>

737
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:58,595
You've missed the soup
and the fish! Lift the roast!

738
01:13:03,639 --> 01:13:07,665
You seem a little shy. Let me
introduce you to that leg of mutton.

739
01:13:08,289 --> 01:13:11,781
Alice, Leg of Mutton. Leg of Mutton, Alice.

740
01:13:11,838 --> 01:13:13,617
How do you do?

741
01:13:15,438 --> 01:13:16,939
May I give you a slice?

742
01:13:17,139 --> 01:13:20,944
Certainly not! It isn't etiquette to cut
somebody you've been introduced to.

743
01:13:21,038 --> 01:13:22,638
Remove the roast!

744
01:13:29,038 --> 01:13:32,195
Please don't introduce the Pudding,
or we shall get no dinner at all.

745
01:13:32,222 --> 01:13:33,338
May I give you some?

746
01:13:33,537 --> 01:13:35,938
Pudding, Alice. Alice, Pudding.

747
01:13:38,738 --> 01:13:40,537
What impertinence!

748
01:13:41,038 --> 01:13:45,604
How you'd like it, if I were to cut
a slice out of you... you creature?

749
01:13:45,738 --> 01:13:50,637
Make a remark, it's ridiculous to leave
all the conversation to the Pudding.

750
01:13:51,337 --> 01:13:53,894
- Well...
- You'd better prepare.

751
01:13:53,944 --> 01:13:56,037
We are about to drink to your health.

752
01:13:56,637 --> 01:14:01,236
Queen Alice's health!
Queen Alice's health!

753
01:14:01,263 --> 01:14:03,104
Queen Alice! Queen Alice!

754
01:14:04,889 --> 01:14:06,002
Queen Alice!

755
01:14:07,128 --> 01:14:08,232
Queen Alice!

756
01:14:08,436 --> 01:14:10,033
She ought to make a speech.

757
01:14:10,060 --> 01:14:12,034
- A speech!
- So she ought!

758
01:14:12,084 --> 01:14:14,450
- A speech! - A speech! - A speech! - A speech!

759
01:14:14,477 --> 01:14:18,527
Speech! Speech! Queen Alice! Speech!

760
01:14:19,537 --> 01:14:21,625
I rise to return thanks.

761
01:14:24,136 --> 01:14:28,136
Take Care! Something's going to
happen! Something's going to happen!

762
01:14:32,082 --> 01:14:33,946
Here I am.

763
01:15:17,348 --> 01:15:22,205
There was a looking glass room,
and you were the Red Queen.

764
01:15:31,233 --> 01:15:34,869
There was a whole looking glass country.
