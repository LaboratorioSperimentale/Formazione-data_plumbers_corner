1
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:23,152
Cherry ripe, Cherry ripe,

2
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:32,672
ripe I cry fools and fair ones come and buy!

3
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:40,997
Cherry ripe, Cherry ripe, ripe I cry...

4
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,639
Alice...

5
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,639
what's the matter, child?

6
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,199
You look as pale as a ghost.

7
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,997
I can't do it, Nanny!

8
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,438
They don't expect you to sing until after tea...

9
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,516
you've got another half an hour to practice.

10
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:05,039
And relax... drink a strong cup of herbal tea...

11
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,958
it's what I used to do when
I was on the boards...

12
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,474
I can't do it. I can't sing.

13
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,112
It's just stage fright...

14
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,832
there's nothing to be afraid of...

15
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,438
I shall be with you...

16
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,909
it's all in the mind, child.

17
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,153
You can't make me sing!

18
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,310
I won't! I won't!

19
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,476
Now, we'll have none of that, young lady.

20
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,716
Everyone's here. Have you seen my...

21
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,400
Mummy, please don't make me sing!

22
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,079
She's a little nervous, Ma'am.

23
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,912
Perfectly natural... I've seen it often.

24
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,716
Alice, you promised me and your father.

25
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,631
All the guests are so looking forward to it.

26
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,676
It's expected.

27
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,157
Of course, dear, if you really don't want
to your father and I will understand

28
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,589
though we'll be very disappointed.

29
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,797
I don't want to disappoint you and daddy.

30
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,999
Don't worry darling...

31
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,032
I'm sure you'll make us all very proud.

32
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,474
And remember Alice, whatever happens...

33
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,638
flood or earthquake... the show must go on.

34
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,156
"Cherry ripe, cherry ripe,

35
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:15,634
ripe I cry... fools and fair
ones come and buy...

36
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,592
Oh what am I going to do, Dinah?

37
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,395
Of all the songs I have to sing "Cherry Ripe"!

38
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,752
How can they expect me to sing
in front of all these strangers.

39
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,720
I'll go back later when it's all over!

40
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,035
Oh dear, oh!

41
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,550
Oh me! Oh, oh,

42
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:04,989
oh dear, oh dear, oh dear

43
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:09,989
I'll be so late! Oooh, Oh me.

44
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,115
Oh dear.

45
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:25,072
I wonder what Latitude
or Longitude I've got to?

46
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,433
I've no idea what Latitude and
Longitude are, but they're grand words

47
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,191
Longitude and Latitude

48
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:43,960
Oh my furry ears and whiskers,
look how late it's getting!

49
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:56,477
Perhaps I fell right through the earth,
and come out the other side...

50
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,315
I shall have to ask somebody
the name of the country...

51
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,109
"Please Ma'am, is this New
Zealand or Australia?"

52
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,871
That's strange...

53
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,390
Now that I'm in, how do I get out?

54
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,714
If only I was smaller...

55
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,594
That wasn't there before,

56
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,513
I wonder if it's alright to drink.

57
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,160
If you drink too much from
a bottle marked poison

58
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,596
it's almost certain to disagree
with you sooner or later.

59
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,035
This bottle's not marked "Poison".

60
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,115
Hmm...

61
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,948
Oh no.

62
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,994
Now what am I supposed to do?

63
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,828
Curiouser and curiouser.

64
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:27,279
If it makes me grow taller
then I can reach the key...

65
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,952
and if it makes me grow smaller
I can creep under the door...

66
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,638
either way I'll get into the garden!

67
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,719
I'm stuck,

68
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:06,316
I'm stuck. What am I suppose to do?

69
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,395
Oh! The Duchess'll be absolutely
savage if I keep her waiting.

70
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,869
Please sir, can you help me?!

71
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,872
Are you crying?

72
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,515
Yes.

73
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,312
Well, fortunately I speak "crying"
and "sobbing" fluently...

74
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,959
but I can't stay...

75
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,754
- I'm late!
- No.

76
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,840
Yesterday everything was so normal...

77
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,709
Now look at me. I'm huge, and I'm stuck!

78
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,669
I wonder what's making me grow smaller?

79
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,311
It must be this fan.

80
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,274
Mr Mouse!

81
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,553
Mr Mouse...

82
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,508
Mr Mouse.

83
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,876
How did you know my name, young lady.

84
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,679
You did look like a mouse...

85
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,557
I'm late. Come with me,

86
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:22,236
I've a very important lecture to
deliver and everyone will be there!

87
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:30,471
My lectures, my lectures have to be
seen and heard to be depreciated...

88
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,994
of course they divide people...

89
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,759
Last time the whole audience hissed.

90
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,394
Hissed! All except one man.

91
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,351
He was applauding the hissing.

92
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:48,239
What am I going to talk about?
What am I going to do?

93
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:53,991
Whatever it is I'll talk about,
you can be sure it isn't new

94
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,997
Not new.

95
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,878
Not new.

96
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,232
I am an English lecturer

97
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,231
The most famous of my time.

98
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,198
Because I stick with the same old words

99
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,670
And never change a line.

100
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,515
Not a line,

101
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:23,077
not, not a line...

102
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,000
Not a line...

103
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,028
My mother couldn't carry a
tune not even if it had handles.

104
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,833
Silly old trout.

105
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,190
A most depressing venue...

106
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,875
The distemper's coming off at the knees...

107
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,352
Still the audience look lively enough.

108
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,749
That's the main thing...

109
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,468
I mean they're not dead. Not yet...

110
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,799
What's your name, if it isn't a rude question?

111
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,955
Alice.

112
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,672
Oh well,

113
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,039
that's not your fault...

114
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,998
Err... you're wet!

115
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,359
Sit down...

116
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,949
I'll soon make her dry enough.

117
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,113
My lecture is the driest
thing I've ever heard of.

118
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:28,073
Settle down everybody
whilst I clear my throat.

119
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,555
Get on with it!

120
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,755
Walnuts!

121
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,034
Oh well,

122
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,593
now then...

123
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,553
"William the Conqueror,

124
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,354
whose cause was favored by the Pope,

125
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,953
Ooooh...

126
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,149
Did you speak?

127
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,357
I don't think so.

128
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,589
"Edwin and Morcar, the Earls
of Mercia and Northumbria,

129
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,272
declared for him...

130
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:02,076
and even Stigand, the patriotic
Archbishop of Canterbury

131
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:07,314
found it advisable to go with
Edgar Altheling to meet William

132
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,829
and offer him the crown.

133
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,672
How are you getting on now, my dear?

134
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:15,669
I'm as wet as ever, it doesn't
seem to dry me at all.

135
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,354
Are you sure?

136
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,110
I don't like the sound of it.

137
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,434
None of use do...

138
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:26,673
in which case I move that
the meeting adjourn...

139
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,879
And we immediately, if not sooner,

140
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:37,637
adopt more energetic remedies to
facilitate a cure for wetness, per se...

141
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,789
Speak English!

142
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,668
What I was going to say was, ipso facto...

143
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:49,029
the best thing to get her dry would be...

144
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,868
a caucus-race!

145
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,599
What's a caucus-race?!

146
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,639
A caucus-race! A caucus-race!

147
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,199
What's a caucus-race?

148
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,838
I'll pack a few things!

149
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,989
Now you're talking.

150
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,311
Yes I'm talking, now what's a caucus-race?!

151
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:09,354
The best way to explain a
caucus-race is - to do it.

152
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,350
On your marks,

153
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,157
get set...

154
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,153
go!

155
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,672
It's a blistering race!

156
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:37,869
An extraordinary display of skill,
determination and sheer stupidity!

157
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,148
They're all cheating!

158
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,911
That's caucus-race!

159
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,313
So perish all enemies of the Tsar!

160
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,755
And there's more where that came from!

161
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,552
So you think I'm a cheat do you?!

162
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,278
No just deformed.

163
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,750
No man calls me deformed
unless he's certified!

164
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,070
Look! Look... the finishing post!

165
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,635
Who's won?!

166
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,749
Who's won?!

167
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,072
I vouchsafe that everybody won...

168
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,076
and that we must all have prizes.

169
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,912
Who's going to give the prizes?!

170
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,753
Why, Alice of course!

171
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,516
Um...

172
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,269
Ha!

173
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,670
I think it's time we were all in
bed with a cup of hot chocolate.

174
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,030
Indubitably!

175
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,875
Wait.

176
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,758
Where are you all going.

177
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,389
Wait!

178
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,269
Oh the Duchess!

179
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,679
Oh the Duchess!

180
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,752
Oh, my sweet paws. Oh my fur and whiskers!

181
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:49,236
She'll get me executed as
sure as ferrets are ferrets.

182
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,713
Oh what've you lost, sir?

183
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,791
A pair of white kid gloves and a fan.

184
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,439
Oh... I'll help you find them.

185
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,155
Hm hm, what are you doing here?!

186
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,233
I'm trying to get into the beautiful garden.

187
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:03,113
Run home and fetch me another
pair of gloves and a fan!

188
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,589
Quick!

189
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,951
He's treating me as if I'm his housemaid!

190
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,155
Frederick Rabbit's house!

191
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,196
He lives very well for a rabbit.

192
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,834
Some of these things must be priceless...

193
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,796
or even more expensive.

194
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,795
It doesn't say "Drink Me" like the other bottle.

195
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,910
I'm sure it'll make something
interesting happen.

196
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,590
I just hope it makes me grow large again.

197
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,312
Err - that's enough!

198
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,433
Oh dear - what am I going to do?!

199
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,629
Oh, dear!

200
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,035
Hm...

201
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,356
It's stuck.

202
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,308
I'll try the back window.

203
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,719
Wah!

204
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:35,156
Uh - oh...

205
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,392
Pat! Pat!

206
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,791
I'm here, your honour, I'm here.

207
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,474
I was er, out the front digging for apples...

208
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:49,393
Ah, for sure, it's a dewy dawn when the
larks on the wing and the snail's on the horn.

209
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:52,472
What? Oh not now, Pat...
just help me out of this.

210
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,751
Alright, come on, up come on.

211
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,114
Lets have you.

212
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,556
Oh, oh no. That won't do the
vegetables any good, your honour.

213
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,636
Why're we growing cucumbers, Pat?

214
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,551
Because they're green, your worship.

215
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:07,428
I thought so... Now tell me,
Pat, what's that in the window?

216
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,032
Let's have a look. Hang on a sec.

217
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,474
That's an arm your worship!

218
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:16,791
An arm! Whoever saw an arm that size?

219
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,552
No-one, but sure, it's still an arm.

220
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,239
Well it's no business there... remove it!

221
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,556
Me, your worship?

222
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,870
Yes, you. Are you a coward?

223
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,393
Oh no, not at all...

224
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,159
I might have coward's legs but
the rest of me's brave as a lion.

225
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,117
There's nothing to be afraid of.

226
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,349
Well then you do it!

227
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,238
I'm too rich, I can't afford to die.

228
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,394
Will somebody please help me?

229
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,755
I'm stuck!

230
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,188
I'm stuck!

231
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:51,279
Why won't anyone help
me? I can't do it by myself!

232
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,555
Why do you keep failing
like that. Your honour?

233
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,959
I like it!

234
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,434
- Oh help me up.
- Oh, right so.

235
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,750
Here take me right hand, there we go...

236
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,916
No that... That's me right hand!

237
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,991
Oooo, ooo. Bill!

238
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,476
Hello!

239
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,675
You're needed, lad!

240
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,508
What's the matter, sirs?

241
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,239
The Master's got a terrible case of the 'falls'!

242
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,349
Get a ladder!

243
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,039
Oh! Right.

244
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,758
Now be careful with the ladder, lad

245
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,195
You might... hit... Oh!

246
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,269
Oh...

247
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,395
Sorry sir!

248
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,631
Oh. Put the ladder up against the house.

249
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,030
Oh, yes, yes that's good.

250
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,712
Now climb up.

251
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:36,876
What for?

252
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,238
You've got to get on the roof, slide down
the chimney and see who's in the house.

253
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,070
Why?

254
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,873
Because I can't get through
the door or windows.

255
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,036
Ah now sir, that's a mighty clever idea.

256
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,236
But you see, I've got a
bad back for chimneys.

257
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,719
I inherited it from my mother.

258
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,671
We've always had terrible
backs for chimneys!

259
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,716
Oh you do it, Bill!

260
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,510
Who me?

261
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,788
Yes you!

262
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,950
Oh... alright then.

263
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,949
Quick. Hurry!

264
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:17,317
Now careful, Bill, there's a loose
slate up there somewhere.

265
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,314
Ah, good man, you've found it!

266
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,835
Pat, tell him to climb down the chimney.

267
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,676
Bill.

268
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,431
Ow.

269
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,674
...climb down the chimney!

270
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,039
He shouldn't do that?!

271
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,357
Not down the chimney... don't try it!

272
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,630
Ya-hoo!

273
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,715
There goes Bill.

274
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:16,276
Oh. Oh dear.

275
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:20,120
Bill! Bill! What happened, lad?

276
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,515
Hold up his head... here's brandy

277
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,312
Ah thank you, your worship

278
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,913
Not you!

279
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:29,357
Ah sorry, purely medicinal, runs in the family.

280
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,668
What happened, Bill?

281
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,917
Well something comes at me,

282
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:38,632
like a Jack-in-the-box, and then
up I goes like a sky-rocket.

283
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,915
Spoken like a true Irishman, Bill.

284
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,638
I don't like the look of this.

285
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,159
There's nothing for it!

286
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,714
We must burn down the house!

287
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,954
Good thinking, your worship.

288
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,315
Would you like me to sing
some melodies of Old Ireland?

289
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,790
No, just burn down the house!

290
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,233
Oh, no you don't!

291
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,593
You're not burning down
this house while I'm inside!

292
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,033
Ha ha. A barrow full should do!

293
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,115
Ready, aim...

294
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:13,956
Fire!

295
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:21,192
Ah, stop it. You'd better not do that again!

296
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,230
Hmm.

297
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,070
They're not real pebbles

298
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,839
They're soft like sponge cakes...

299
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:21,396
Now I must go and find that lovely garden.

300
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,990
No one will think of looking for me there.

301
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,519
Everything seems different from down here.

302
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,518
I have to keep looking up.

303
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,835
I'm sure little people must
get very bad neck strain.

304
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,629
It's enough to make a cat bark.

305
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,952
I used to read fairy tales,

306
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,032
I never thought I would end
up in the middle of one.

307
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,991
There ought to be a book written about me.

308
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,109
Maybe when I grow up I'll write one.

309
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,148
Sir.

310
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,600
Sir, who do I have the honour of addressing?

311
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,230
Major Caterpillar, ribbon and bar...

312
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,072
Late of "Her Majesty's Foot and Light"...

313
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,628
A true son of England and it's flag what...

314
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:43,990
Who're you?

315
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,991
I don't really know.

316
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,917
If you don't, I don't!

317
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,156
I know who I was this morning

318
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:54,198
but I think I've been changed
several times since then.

319
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:57,556
Explain yourself or you'll
find yourself on a charge.

320
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:03,716
Well, I can't explain myself, sir,
because I'm not myself, you see.

321
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,159
No, I don't see.

322
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,673
Everyone should be the
right size, shouldn't they.

323
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,158
But I've been so many different
sizes in one day it's very confusing.

324
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,468
Why?

325
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,318
Well, if you were to change...

326
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:21,234
into a butterfly say you'd find
it quite strange, wouldn't you?

327
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,589
Not a bit of it! Nothing's strange to me!

328
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,671
I don't think you should talk to me like that.

329
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,357
Like what?

330
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,759
In short sentences.

331
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,518
Oh, ah a ooo-

332
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:32,199
All I know is that it's very disturbing,

333
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,271
sometimes I start crying.

334
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,031
Why?

335
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,953
Because I don't remember
things like I used to

336
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,958
and I can't keep the same
size for ten minutes together.

337
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,473
That's a rum do.

338
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,317
I'd keep an eye on it if I were you...

339
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,436
Can't remember what things exactly?

340
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,959
Songs and poems.

341
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,037
Gad, it's worse than having a beri-beri.

342
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:56,438
Umm, recite "You Are Old, Father William".

343
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:00,275
Stand up, girl... you can't sing
or recite without standing up.

344
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,112
Well that's just it... I don't want to!

345
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,713
No, no elbows all wrong.

346
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,279
Tuck'em in! Tuck'em in!

347
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,351
Good! Try and keep in tune!

348
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,993
"You are old, Father
William", the Young Man said

349
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,469
"And your hair has become very white;

350
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:20,712
And yet you incessantly stand on your head.

351
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:24,833
Do you think, at your
age, this is right?" Hmm?

352
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:32,988
I don't know if you were trying for the
"Paganini Variations" for voice and trumpet,

353
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,991
but you missed five verses.

354
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,350
Some of the words did get a little altered.

355
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,591
Young lady, it was wrong
from beginning to end.

356
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,279
And you can't get wronger than that!

357
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,670
I'm afraid that's what always
happens when I have to perform!

358
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,595
You mustn't be afraid, that's
worse than not remembering.

359
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,119
Oh... dear!

360
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,553
What size do you want to be?!

361
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,318
Speak up! Speak up!

362
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,873
I don't care about the size,

363
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:00,071
just so long as I'm not changing
all the time, you know.

364
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,269
No, I don't know.

365
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,635
There you go again with short sentences!

366
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,359
There you go, losing your temper.

367
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,317
It's against Queens Regulations!

368
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,197
Do you like your size right now?

369
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:13,590
I'd like to be little taller...
this is a terrible height to be.

370
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:16,473
Terrible?! Gad, woah!

371
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:22,598
One side will make you taller and
the other side will make you shorter.

372
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,517
One side of what?

373
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,794
The mushroom...

374
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,472
that's what it's there for...

375
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:35,594
everything has a purpose even here.

376
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,398
Thank you, Major.

377
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,438
Ha ha ha ha ha...

378
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,679
One side makes me taller.

379
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:10,072
The other side will make me shorter.

380
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,630
I wonder which one is which.

381
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,149
Mmmm...

382
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:45,557
I think I'll keep these, they
may come in handy later.

383
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,796
That looks respectable,

384
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:53,112
I wonder if they'll be able
to give me directions...

385
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:15,749
For the Duchess, an invitation
from the Queen to play croquet.

386
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:19,469
From the Queen, an invitation
for the Duchess to play croquet.

387
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:24,879
An invitation to play croquet,
from the Queen, for the Duchess.

388
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,159
I've got the gist.

389
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:29,995
Are you sure?

390
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:34,790
Yes, it's an invitation from the Queen
for the Duchess to play croquet.

391
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:41,311
Hm, I wouldn't put it quite like
that, but it'll have to do I suppose.

392
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,232
It's no good you knocking like that.

393
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,948
Why not?

394
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,832
Two good reasons.

395
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,198
One, because I'm on the same
side of the door as you...

396
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,479
Oh yes.

397
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:27,390
Two, they're making so much
noise inside, no-one can hear you.

398
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,995
But how am I going to get inside?

399
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,877
That is the question.

400
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:37,439
The problem. You might even
say, the conundrum or riddle.

401
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,238
Yes, I might.

402
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:42,551
There'd be some sense in you
knocking if we had a door between us.

403
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:47,512
I could go and get a spare door
but that would take too long.

404
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,349
On the other hand, if you
were inside the house,

405
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:53,000
you could knock, and I could let you out...

406
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,828
Knock, knock...

407
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,789
This way out, Madame.

408
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,470
But I don't want to go out, I want to go in!

409
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:12,629
Of course, but if you did want
to go out it'd be much easier.

410
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:19,037
Meanwhile, I'm going to
sit here until tomorrow.

411
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,791
Or the next day perhaps,

412
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,476
or even for a whole week,

413
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,349
then I can come back by popular demand.

414
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,639
But how am I supposed to get inside?

415
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,757
I need to ask them a question.

416
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:40,192
Will you ever get in, is the
question you should be asking?

417
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,154
I'm going to sit here for days
thinking about it and singing

418
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:47,195
"Coming Through the Rye".

419
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:53,472
Dee da dada dar dee dar
da dar dee dar dee dar dum

420
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:57,434
It's no use talking to you!
I'll just have to do it myself.

421
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,317
That's the spirit!

422
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,436
Pepper!

423
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,998
I want pepper!

424
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:18,029
Pepper! More pepper...

425
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:23,031
More pepper!

426
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,634
More pepper!

427
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,750
Please could you tell me why your
cat is grinning at me like that?

428
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,277
He's a Cheshire-Cat.

429
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,555
Cheshire-Cat's always grin.

430
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,673
Isn't that so, Piggy?

431
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,312
I didn't know Cheshire-Cats always grinned.

432
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,392
In fact I didn't know cats could grin.

433
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,829
Uh ho, well you don't know
very much then do you.

434
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,148
Isn't that so Piggy!

435
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,679
Are you really a Duchess?

436
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,629
Every inch!

437
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:17,428
Pepper! Pepper! Pepper!

438
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,560
Be careful! You almost
hit his poor little nose!

439
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:23,869
Nonsense!

440
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:27,799
He can already play "Three
Blind Mice" on his nose-flute!

441
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,953
What do you want little Miss?!

442
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,150
I want to know how to get into the garden?

443
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,515
Oh - now you're talking,

444
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,990
but I prefer singing to talking, don't you?

445
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,235
Let's have a song.

446
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:45,791
"Speak roughly to the little boy,

447
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:50,311
And beat him when he sneezes.

448
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,437
He only does it to annoy.

449
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:58,395
Because he knows it teases."

450
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:19,155
"I speak severely to my boy,

451
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:22,915
I beat him when he sneezes.

452
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:31,317
For he can thoroughly enjoy
the pepper when he pleases"

453
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,992
Here you nurse for a bit...

454
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,476
I've got an appointment... can't wait.

455
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:03,469
Pepper! More pepper!

456
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:06,028
I best get you out of here.
They're sure to kill you!

457
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:11,394
More pepper! Pepper!

458
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,508
I thought you wanted to go in?

459
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,079
I've been in... now I'm coming out.

460
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:24,076
Life is so complicated!

461
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:30,558
You mustn't grunt like that. You
sounds as if you've turned into a pig.

462
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,871
You have turned into a pig!

463
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,993
I'd best let you go.

464
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,356
Go on.

465
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:49,399
When he gets older he'll
make a very ugly child...

466
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,232
or a very handsome pig...

467
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,351
Now which way?

468
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,798
Ah!

469
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:08,637
Cheshire-Puss, can you
tell me which way to go?

470
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,599
Well that depends on
where you want to get to.

471
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:12,750
The garden!

472
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,359
Why do you want to go there?

473
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,959
It looks safe.

474
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,039
Sometimes things that
look safe turn out nasty...

475
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:23,112
and things that look nasty turn out safe.

476
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,713
That's immoral.

477
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:28,999
What sort of people live around here?

478
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:32,437
Well a Hatter lives over there.

479
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,109
Follow my pointed paw.

480
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:47,994
And a gentleman called Hare
nicknamed March lives there.

481
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,356
They're probably having a tea party.

482
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:51,520
They're both mad.

483
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:52,440
They're both mad.
But I don't want to meet mad people.

484
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,873
But I don't want to meet mad people.

485
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,559
Oh, but you can't help it,
everyone here is mad.

486
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,279
I'm mad, you're mad.

487
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:02,432
It's only by chance and
careful planning if you're not.

488
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:04,351
How do you know I'm mad?

489
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,039
Because you're here!

490
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,674
And everyone here is mad.

491
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,912
I went to a Hunt Ball once, I didn't like it...

492
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:17,630
Terrible people. They all started hunting me!

493
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,956
Hm... Life must be hard for you?

494
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:21,758
But I grin a bear it...

495
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:25,797
By-the-by, what became of the baby?

496
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:29,118
It turned into a pig.

497
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:33,836
I knew it would, it's the same
with crows and moor-hens.

498
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:39,714
Did you say "pig" or "fig"?

499
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,912
I said "pig".

500
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:45,316
And I wish you wouldn't keep appearing
and disappearing so suddenly.

501
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:46,952
You're making me very dizzy!

502
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,433
So sorry... is this better?

503
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,757
Which way shall you go?

504
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,512
Which path shall you take?

505
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,956
If you don't take any you will make a mistake.

506
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,718
Which way shall you go?

507
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,472
Which path shall you take?

508
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:14,951
You have to move on though
you tremble and quake...

509
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:21,036
Hmm the Cheshire Cat was
right. They are having tea.

510
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:24,509
I wonder if they'd mind if I joined them?

511
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,795
Have you any more food down there, Dormy?

512
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,838
Any spoilt sandwiches or strawberries?

513
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:35,195
I love strawberries, don't you? Aha ha ha ha.

514
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,350
I'm sure he's hoarding them!

515
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:38,555
Oh haw haw haw...

516
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,632
I'm lost... could I... get

517
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:43,073
No room.

518
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,513
There's no room.

519
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:47,837
There's plenty of room.

520
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:51,877
Why didn't you report this sooner, Hatty?

521
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,433
I overslept.

522
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,990
Why're you here?

523
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:58,719
Well, I've been looking for
the pretty garden all day...

524
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,512
and now I'm tired, and hungry.

525
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:02,511
Oh, that's different.

526
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:05,194
We've been eating for hours.

527
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,395
And we've not finished yet.

528
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:10,671
Waiter, waiter, there's a hair in my soup!

529
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:13,638
Is it blonde? We're missing a waitress.

530
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:25,273
Have some wine!

531
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:27,869
I don't see any wine.

532
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:30,588
There isn't any and you're too young.

533
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:33,274
Then it wasn't very nice of you to offer it.

534
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:37,199
It wasn't very nice of you to
sit down without an invitation.

535
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:40,437
This is a private soiree.

536
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:42,670
Well I suppose I should've just barged in.

537
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:47,311
I know I wasn't invited but the table
was laid out for a lot of people.

538
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:50,153
My response to that is both
profound a meaningful.

539
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,879
Get your hair cut!

540
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,798
You shouldn't make personal
remarks, it's very rude.

541
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:04,796
I didn't know that. Personal
remarks are rude?

542
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:05,829
Hm hmm.

543
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,116
E'gad, you learn something new everyday.

544
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:11,357
Make a note of that, Marchy,
it might come in useful.

545
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:14,633
Now I have one for you...

546
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:18,558
Why is a raven like a writing desk?

547
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:21,629
Why is a raven...?

548
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,512
I'm not talking to you...

549
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:26,438
Why not, aren't I good enough?

550
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,516
You've heard it before.

551
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:31,672
But you were looking at me when
you said "Why is a raven...?"

552
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:33,039
I'm asking Alice!

553
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:42,079
Um, why is raven like a writing desk.

554
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,913
You know - I'm pretty sure I can guess.

555
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:48,994
You mean you think you know the answer?

556
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:50,396
Yes.

557
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:52,272
Then you should say what you mean.

558
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:55,993
Well I do... at... at least...

559
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,752
At least I mean what I say...

560
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:59,273
That... that is the same thing.

561
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:01,151
It's not the same thing at all.

562
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:05,677
You might as well say "I see what I eat"
is the same thing as "I eat what I see"

563
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:12,556
You might as well say "I like
what I get" as "I get what I like."

564
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:14,509
Ahhh! Oh!

565
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,192
You or you might as well say

566
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:23,356
"I breathe when I asleep" is the same
thing as "I sleep when I breathe."

567
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,118
Well it is the same with you!

568
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:30,157
No no, oh I need some sleep.

569
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,355
Clean cups!

570
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:39,230
Time marches on it's stomach! Ah ha ha ha.

571
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:42,270
It's an army that marches on its stomach.

572
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:46,877
Odd sort of army, marching on it's stomach.

573
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:49,230
I don't like the idea. Yuck!

574
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,313
What day of month is it?

575
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:52,796
The fourth.

576
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,757
Ah-ah! Two days wrong!

577
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,155
I told you not to use butter.

578
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:00,915
- It was the best butter.
- Danish.

579
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,912
Some crumbs must've got into it as well...

580
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,709
I said, "don't put butter in the
works with a bread knife".

581
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:10,718
I couldn't put it in with a fork could I?

582
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,153
Here, let me see.

583
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:16,195
I don't want to give it to you - but I will.

584
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:19,997
Ohh!

585
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:21,354
Ahhgh!

586
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:26,393
I don't understand it... it was the best butter.

587
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:27,629
Danish.

588
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,119
That's a funny watch.

589
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,553
It tells the day of the month but not the time.

590
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:39,192
Why should it... does your
watch tell you what year it is?

591
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:42,389
No. Because it stays a year for so long.

592
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:43,873
Oh well then I rest my case.

593
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:44,955
Where?

594
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:45,916
There!

595
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,673
I know when I'm beaten.

596
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:55,036
Oh look. Mr Dormouse is asleep again.

597
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:59,438
It tells you a lot about your conversation...

598
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:01,631
Sparkle, Miss, sparkle!

599
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,199
Of course, of course,

600
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:06,989
I was just going to say that myself... I'm...

601
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:09,036
I'm asleep... again...

602
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:14,393
Have you guessed the
riddle about the raven yet?

603
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:17,120
Um hmm no, I give up... what's the answer?

604
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,236
I haven't the slightest idea.

605
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:20,799
Nor me.

606
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:22,877
I think you should all do
something better with the time

607
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:25,713
than wasting it on asking stupid riddles.

608
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:29,952
If you knew Time the way I do, you
wouldn't talk about wasting "it".

609
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,991
Time is a "him".

610
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:34,235
"It" isn't polite.

611
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:36,197
I don't know what you mean.

612
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:37,798
Of course you don't!

613
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:40,155
Because you've never
spoken to Time have you?

614
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:42,159
Well I have.

615
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:44,993
We used to be very good friends...

616
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:49,279
We served the Empire, in many a distant
post before they all got woodworm.

617
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:52,600
But we quarreled last March...

618
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,597
just before he went mad.

619
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,193
Flatterer!

620
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:00,113
It was at the great concert
given by the Queen of Hearts!

621
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:03,476
Quick, stop him, he's going to sing... too late!

622
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:06,233
Thank you ladies and gentlemen.
How terribly sweet of you.

623
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:12,473
And now for a little encore I'd like to a
song entitled "Auntie's Wooden Leg".

624
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:14,476
Maestro, if you please...

625
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:22,033
"Oh Auntie's wooden
leg, Auntie's wooden leg.

626
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:25,755
We'll paint it red and call
it Fred or Ned or Ted.

627
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:29,509
Oh, Auntie's wooden leg.
Auntie's wooden leg.

628
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:35,112
Everybody said it was well and truly
dead, oh Auntie's wooden leg...

629
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:36,832
I say, I say, I say!"

630
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:39,798
How dare you interrupt my
song with "I say, I say, I say!"

631
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:40,949
I say, I say, I say...

632
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:44,077
In this world it's not what you
know, but who you know.

633
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:45,639
I don't know either one of them.

634
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:47,756
Kindly leave the stage by the red door.

635
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:50,434
There's a fifty foot drop on the other side!

636
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:52,431
But we're still good friends...

637
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:53,919
Dohh!

638
00:51:54,280 --> 00:52:02,312
Auntie's wooden ohh...

639
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:09,749
Uh ha, oh dear dear dear dear dear.

640
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:14,478
Auntie's wooden leg.
Aunties wooden leg, we'II...

641
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:16,596
That's enough of that... or she'll walk out.

642
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:19,270
That's what the audience did at the concert.

643
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:20,793
Try another song.

644
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:23,152
We're desperate men.

645
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:28,199
"Twinkle, twinkle, little bat.

646
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:32,068
How I wonder what you're at!

647
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:39,555
Up above the world you fly.
Like a tea-tray in the sky.

648
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:43,559
Twinkle, twinkle, little twinkle,

649
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:47,400
You don't speak but you will twinkle.

650
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:54,280
Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, little bee,

651
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:57,511
Twinkle, twinkle,

652
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:12,960
I'm so glad it isn't me...

653
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:17,677
Lovely isn't it? It could
almost pass for singing.

654
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:33,670
"Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle..."

655
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:39,237
Anyway, I'd hadn't finished the
second verse at the concert

656
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:42,915
when the Queen bawls out...
"He's murdering the tunc!

657
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,274
Off with his head!"

658
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:46,189
How terrible for you.

659
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:49,750
You're very understanding for a small girl.

660
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,913
Anyway, if you'll pardon the expression,

661
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,151
Time took offence to our performance.

662
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:57,753
Uh - your performance!

663
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:03,554
And ever since then he won't do a
thing we ask... he stopped time.

664
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,557
Could he stop time for me?

665
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:09,952
I have to sing a song.

666
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:14,551
Oh wonderful! We're all performers here.

667
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:18,275
The roar of the greasepaint,
the smell of the crowd...

668
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:19,873
nothing like it!

669
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,399
But I don't want to!

670
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:26,718
Don't want to perform?

671
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:30,116
- It's unnatural.
- No, no, no. Stage fright.

672
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:35,913
I remember my first performance,
I shook so much my hat fell off.

673
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:39,596
If Time stopped time for you,
he could stop time for me.

674
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:41,756
But he only stops time at tea-time.

675
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:43,919
So it's always tea-time here?

676
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:45,759
Tell us a story.

677
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,109
I don't know any.

678
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:50,475
Then Dormy will.

679
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:51,954
Wake up, Dormy!

680
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:56,390
Ahhrgh! I wasn't asleep.

681
00:54:56,520 --> 00:55:02,117
Oh no... I heard every
word you fellows said...

682
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:04,430
Tell us a story!

683
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:05,316
Please do!

684
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:08,119
And do it quick, otherwise you'll fall
asleep before you've finished it.

685
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:09,918
Once upon a time there were three sisters,

686
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,992
Elsie, Lacie and Tillie and they
lived at the bottom of a well.

687
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:14,593
What did they live on?

688
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:18,237
What did they live on? Treacle!

689
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,998
That would've made them ill.

690
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:23,072
It did. It made them very ill.

691
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:24,389
Have some more tea!

692
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,357
More tea! More tea!

693
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:30,195
I've had nothing yet so I can't have more!

694
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:31,799
You mean you can't have less.

695
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:33,916
It's very easy to have more than nothing.

696
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:35,678
Especially if you're poor.

697
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:40,829
I'd still like to know why they
lived at the bottom of the well?

698
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:44,430
Ah, oh well, it was a treacle-well!

699
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,549
A treacle well?! There's no such thing!

700
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:53,519
Disgraceful! You'll hear from
my solicitor in the morning!

701
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:56,757
Outrageous! What about a
letter to the "The Times"?!

702
00:55:56,840 --> 00:56:00,276
If you can't be civil you can
finish the story yourself.

703
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:01,799
No, no... I'm sorry...

704
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:03,632
I won't interrupt you again...

705
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:05,950
I'm sure there must be,
at least, one treacle-well.

706
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:07,433
Now, where was I?

707
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:12,435
Oh yes... so these three
sisters were learning to draw...

708
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:14,035
Draw what?

709
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:15,753
Treacle!

710
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:17,479
Hole in one!

711
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,993
I want another clean cup... everyone move!

712
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:32,751
What I don't understand is,
how they could draw treacle?

713
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:35,519
You can draw water out of
a water-well, can't you?

714
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,238
Good one, Hatty! Good one!

715
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:43,916
I don't think I like this Tea Party
as much as I thought I would.

716
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,275
Then you shouldn't talk, just hum...

717
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:48,237
because we know you socially, Alice.

718
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:51,039
It doesn't mean we're going to
introduce you to our friends.

719
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:52,599
We haven't got any.

720
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:53,590
But if we had!

721
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,716
Ah, if we had!

722
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,995
I'm no staying here
listening to you being rude!

723
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:00,588
You'll find better places for that I'm sure!

724
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:03,114
Of course she will, if she's lucky!

725
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:05,117
Besides it's going to rain.

726
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:10,040
It never rains but it pours.

727
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:16,280
If it does, we carry on... we're
little heroes, aren't we, Dormy?

728
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:19,836
Officer, these men are criminals!

729
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,512
Who's got his ear trumpet?!

730
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:26,718
It's the most stupid
tea-party I've ever been to.

731
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:28,279
I told you he wouldn't fit.

732
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:31,875
He'll fit, we have to try harder.

733
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,991
I heard that... try harder.

734
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:37,072
Oh ah. No that's my nose.

735
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:42,029
No mind my ears...

736
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:55,193
That's curious...

737
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:21,953
Hmm... This time I'll manage things better.

738
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:15,989
Mmm...

739
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:20,991
At last. The perfect place to hide.

740
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:31,551
Oh look out there, Mr Five,
you're splashing paint!

741
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:34,473
I couldn't help it, Mr Two,
Mr Seven jogged my elbow.

742
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:37,478
Oh that's right, shifting
the responsibility again!

743
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:38,754
Ha, you can talk.

744
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:41,035
I heard the Queen say you
deserved to be beheaded.

745
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:41,711
What for?

746
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:42,471
Tulip-roots.

747
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:43,396
What?

748
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:46,153
For bringing the Cook
tulip-roots instead of onions.

749
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:47,758
Is that all?

750
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:49,956
That's a mistake anyone can make!

751
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:53,790
Hello...

752
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,035
Hello!

753
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:59,276
Why are you painting the roses red?

754
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:04,196
The fact is, Miss, this tree ought by
rights to've been a red rose-tree,

755
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:06,191
and we planted a white one by mistake.

756
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:07,918
Easy thing to do.

757
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:08,790
Yes.

758
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:10,233
If the Queen was to find out...

759
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:12,436
well, the fact is we'd all
have our heads cut off.

760
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:15,159
So you see, Miss, we're doing
our best to put things right.

761
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:16,389
Before she comes.

762
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:29,078
Ah! She's coming now!

763
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:34,633
The Queen! The Queen!

764
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:54,355
Left right, left right, left right, left,

765
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:55,469
Halt!

766
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:06,273
And who is this?

767
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:09,758
I agree entirely.

768
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:12,635
Don't be ridiculous!

769
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:14,557
Would I lie to you, Your Majesty?

770
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:15,550
Yes.

771
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:18,518
Oh well thank you, compliments
are always welcome.

772
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:21,998
You're an idiot!

773
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:23,752
That's right your Majesty.

774
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:27,114
Only you could spot that,
it takes one to know one.

775
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:30,431
A complete idiot!

776
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:34,389
Your name, child?

777
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:39,072
Alice, if it please Your Majesty.

778
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:40,955
Why have we stopped?

779
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:44,955
And who are these?

780
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:48,232
How should I know? I'm a stranger here.

781
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:52,713
Off with her head!

782
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:55,199
Off with her head!

783
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:58,916
Off with her her head!

784
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,958
Stop losing your temper... it's vulgar!

785
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:04,598
Consider, my dear, she's just a child.

786
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:08,192
You think so?

787
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:12,915
Yes that would account for it.

788
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:19,197
Children have no respect
for their betters these days.

789
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:23,710
You three get up!

790
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:26,712
Stop doing that! You're making me dizzy!

791
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:28,715
What is this?

792
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:31,309
If you please Your Majesty, we're trying...

793
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:36,235
Yes, you are aren't you...

794
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:43,551
Very trying... ha ha ha...

795
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:45,955
Off with their heads.

796
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:00,278
I won't let you be beheaded.

797
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:02,234
Quick jump in here.

798
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,197
Do you play croquet?

799
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:33,759
Who, me?!

800
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:35,918
Yes, you!

801
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:40,632
I'm not in the habit of talking to myself

802
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:46,238
if that's the only way I can get an
intelligent conversation round here...

803
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:52,518
Can you play Croquet?

804
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:54,190
Yes.

805
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:56,678
Come on then!

806
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:04,034
Nice day.

807
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:06,191
Very... Where's the Duchess?

808
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:08,953
Oh - Hush... Hush...
she's due to be executed.

809
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:14,074
Get to your places!

810
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:36,716
Don't look at me... look down.

811
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:12,631
Off with his head.

812
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:15,110
Off with her head.

813
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:18,679
Off with her head.

814
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:22,839
I don't like it here... they're too
fond of beheading people...

815
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:29,670
Ah it's the Cheshire Cat!

816
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:33,195
Hello, there...

817
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:34,668
How do you like the game?

818
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:36,832
They don't play very fair.

819
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:39,189
But nobody does if they think
they can get away with it.

820
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:40,918
That's a lesson you'll have to learn.

821
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:43,474
Well, I should've croqueted
the Queen's hedgehog

822
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:45,551
but my hedgehog wouldn't roll into a ball.

823
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:48,837
Well you've got to look at it from
the hedgehog's point of view.

824
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:50,871
Yes, I suppose I should have.

825
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:53,192
How do you like the Queen?

826
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:58,517
I don't... she's so extremely...

827
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:06,433
...likely to win, that it's hardly
worth finishing the game.

828
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:11,795
There's a good, good little girl.

829
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:13,429
Charming.

830
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:15,799
Charming.

831
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:19,195
Who're you talking to?

832
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:22,832
A friend of mine. Cheshire
Cat, this is the King.

833
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:26,756
Urghh - I don't like this at all...

834
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:29,474
but as you're in the presence
you may kiss my hand.

835
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:30,919
I'd rather not.

836
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,035
What?!

837
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:35,635
That's rank insubordination and
you know what that leads to...

838
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:39,038
And don't look at me like that!

839
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:40,951
A cat may look at a King.

840
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:42,635
What does that mean?

841
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:43,994
I read it in a book somewhere.

842
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:45,798
I haven't, but it sounds immoral.

843
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:47,996
It has undertones. That
book should be banned.

844
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:50,548
I like the sound of that.

845
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:53,990
Ah, my dear, how do we
get rid of a floating cat?

846
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:56,072
Off with its head!

847
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:57,429
Brilliant!

848
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:59,556
I knew I could rely on you, my dear.

849
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:01,119
I'll just go and fetch the executioner!

850
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:05,433
Do you know where my hedgehog went?

851
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:08,155
He rolled away over there.

852
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:43,390
Now stop it, it's alright
I'm not going to hurt you.

853
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:47,833
All that's necessary is a swift
chop to the back of the neck!

854
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:49,274
It's difficult!

855
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:51,675
But I must have a ruling!

856
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:53,239
I appeal to you, little girl!

857
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:55,669
You've still got a good
head on your shoulders!

858
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:58,515
No thanks to you.

859
01:08:58,640 --> 01:08:59,709
What?!

860
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:01,392
Ohh!

861
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:04,114
I can't hear what you say.

862
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:06,072
One at a time please!

863
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:08,668
I'm sorry about my altitude.

864
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:11,519
It smacks of revolution! You're above us!

865
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:15,957
My argument is simple and
based on irrefutable logic.

866
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:17,917
I'm Chief Executioner.

867
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:21,515
But I can't cut off an head unless
there's a body to cut it from.

868
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:23,830
This here cat, hanging up there,

869
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:27,799
large as life and twice as
repulsive, has no body...

870
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:31,270
ipso facto, I cannot separate
it from hit's head...

871
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:34,432
My argument is, I venture
to say, overwhelming.

872
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:37,592
Anything that has a head can be beheaded.

873
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:40,592
And don't forget I'm also
a Justice of the Peace.

874
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:44,474
There's too much talk and not enough action.

875
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:46,869
And if something doesn't happen in a minute,

876
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:50,356
I'm going to have everybody executed!

877
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:52,198
You choose, little girl.

878
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:56,155
To behead or not to behead,
that is the question.

879
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:59,636
What's the answer, girl?!

880
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:05,115
You have to tread with care
when dealing with cats.

881
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:11,151
They have influence and are
seen in all the smart places.

882
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:14,475
You remember the Great Cat Massacre.

883
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:18,556
Ah, yes, I was forgetting.

884
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:20,238
Catastrophe.

885
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:23,118
I'd think carefully before acting rashly.

886
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:26,677
Sound advice, little girl.

887
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:35,991
And another thing,

888
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:39,319
the cat belongs to the Duchess.

889
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:43,548
She's in prison... fetch her!

890
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:51,357
I remember the Great Cat
Massacre of '28... nasty business.

891
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:56,076
Yes it was just after the Great
Flamingo Plague of '26 wasn't it?

892
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:57,639
- Shhh.
- What?!

893
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:00,630
Ahh... Duchess.

894
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:07,359
Think carefully before
answering this question...

895
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:11,590
Is this your cat?!

896
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:17,315
No!

897
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:19,994
No? It isn't?

898
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:23,391
I was told... ahh, it's gone!

899
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:25,516
It's your fault! It was in your custody!

900
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:30,714
It wasn't official, so it's nothing to
do with me, mate. I'm in the clear!

901
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:33,712
Help me find it! Everybody help!

902
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:50,556
Quick, quick. Quick.

903
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:57,991
Oh, you can't think how glad I am
to see you again, you old thing.

904
01:11:58,480 --> 01:11:59,469
Thank you.

905
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:02,073
You look worried, my dear?

906
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:04,594
I don't want to go back and sing that song.

907
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:06,392
The show must go on.

908
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:07,589
Why?

909
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:09,989
Life would be very dull if it didn't.

910
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:12,435
Off with your head.

911
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:14,078
The game's going better now.

912
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:15,752
And the moral of that is...

913
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:20,636
"the more there is of mine,
the less there is of yours".

914
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:24,673
Or you could say "fortune favours the brave".

915
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:26,398
I could and I will...

916
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:30,792
"fortune favours the brave".
Oh that's a good moral.

917
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:33,229
You are a clever old thing you. Ohh!

918
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:37,869
Fine day, Your Majesty.

919
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:42,835
I gave you fair warning.

920
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:55,748
Either you or your head must be OFF!

921
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:05,233
Now, my dear, we can finish
our game, before you leave.

922
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:07,556
I'm frightened of going back.

923
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:10,319
They want me to do things I don't want to do.

924
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:14,831
To stay, you have to know the password.

925
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:16,752
I don't know it.

926
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:18,279
Guess.

927
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:20,868
"Penny-whistle".

928
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:22,675
Guess again.

929
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:25,353
"Lions and Unicorns".

930
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:30,150
Almost but not quite. It's "Honeycomb".

931
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:32,431
Can you write that word down?

932
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:33,839
Mmm yes.

933
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:35,668
Blindfolded?

934
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:37,235
Well...

935
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:38,548
I thought not!

936
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:49,119
Come, come, this won't do. Everybody play!

937
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:55,558
Off with their heads.

938
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:59,120
Off with their heads.

939
01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:05,634
Off with everyone's heads!

940
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:11,077
This isn't such a lovely garden after all.

941
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:13,917
Now where have I got to?

942
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:28,638
Hmm... That looks like the coat
of arms we have at home.

943
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:06,113
Hello. Who are you?

944
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:07,514
Alice.

945
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:12,077
Alice? That sounds familiar.

946
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:13,479
And who are you?

947
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:15,558
A gryphon...

948
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:20,555
part eagle, part lion.

949
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:23,234
The best of each I always say.

950
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:26,352
Hmm, I thought you were
a mythical creature?

951
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:32,635
I am... that makes me even more fascinating.

952
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:35,154
Is there a way out of this maze, sir?

953
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:37,754
Let's ask Mr Mock Turtle.

954
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:42,432
He's my best friend... splendid fellow.

955
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:45,993
True blue through and through...

956
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:01,394
Rise and shine, old chum.

957
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:34,676
Oh, is there something wrong?

958
01:16:34,760 --> 01:16:37,228
No, no, no. It's his fancy.

959
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:43,873
Who knows what sad thoughts tiptoe
through the mossy glades of his mind.

960
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:51,192
I know how to cheer him up.

961
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:55,552
Ah, Mockers tell this
young lady about yourself.

962
01:16:56,560 --> 01:17:00,633
She's come to right person for
that... sit down, both of you.

963
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:02,239
Er no thanks, I've heard it before.

964
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:05,192
Sit down... it's the least you can do.

965
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:22,235
Once, ahhh haaa... I was a real turtle

966
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:25,756
I was a real... I was a real...

967
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:33,599
Thank you for that very interesting story sir.

968
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:35,113
I haven't started yet!

969
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:37,390
Stay, you may learn something.

970
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:40,473
You must've learned a lot
since you've been down here?

971
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:42,710
Yes I suppose I have.

972
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:46,795
When Gryph and I were little, we
went to school in the same sea,

973
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:50,754
and the Master was an old turtle.
We used to call him "tortoise".

974
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:54,919
Why would you call him
"tortoise" if he wasn't one?

975
01:17:56,160 --> 01:17:59,789
We called him " tortoise
"because he taught us.

976
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:05,637
You ought to be ashamed of yourself,
asking a simple question like that.

977
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:11,671
He taught us reeling and writing, and
the basic fundamentals of Arithmetic.

978
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:16,316
Ambition, Distraction, Qualification
and we also learnt Drawling

979
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:19,710
The Drawling Master was an old conger-eel.

980
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:25,238
He taught us Drawling.
Stretching and Fainting in Coils.

981
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:26,349
Whoao!

982
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:27,919
What was that like?

983
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:30,395
I'll show you.

984
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,149
I'll have it in a minute.

985
01:18:55,240 --> 01:18:56,992
I can't show it to you myself.

986
01:18:57,080 --> 01:18:58,798
I'm a little too stiff.

987
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:02,119
Old age is not for weaklings.

988
01:19:02,280 --> 01:19:04,236
And Gryphon, here, never
learnt it, did you, Gryph?

989
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:05,958
I didn't time...

990
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:10,716
I went to the Classical Master
though... what an old crab he was.

991
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:12,751
Tell her about the games!

992
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:14,597
Woo Cho cho cho cho choo -

993
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:18,155
You may never have lived in the sea

994
01:19:18,240 --> 01:19:20,834
so you've probably never
been introduced to a lobster.

995
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,036
I once tasted a Io...

996
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:24,479
You what-what-what-what?!

997
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:25,879
Nothing.

998
01:19:26,240 --> 01:19:28,674
You've never seen a Lobster-Quadrille then?!

999
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:31,115
No, what sort of dance is that?

1000
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:32,758
Ha da cha cha cha chaa...

1001
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:34,677
This will give you some
idea of what it looks like.

1002
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:37,911
First you have to clear away all the jelly-fish.

1003
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:41,191
You don't want to dance on top
of a lot of jelly-fish, do you?

1004
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:43,913
Yah! Woo, Mmmm.

1005
01:19:44,840 --> 01:19:46,717
You have a line of dancers...

1006
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:50,833
turtles, salmon, cod, skate.
Whoever's available.

1007
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:53,115
And each one has a lobster
Don't forget about the lobsters!

1008
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:58,354
Yes, then you advance twice, change
lobsters and retire in the same order...

1009
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:03,668
Then, you throw the lobsters into the air.

1010
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:07,031
Then you change lobsters again.

1011
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:12,189
And that, little girl, is the
first figure of the dance!

1012
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:13,548
It's a beautiful dance.

1013
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:16,558
Oh, it is and it costs a pretty penny.

1014
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:18,312
And a few ugly ones too.

1015
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:20,790
Now, we'll show it to you.

1016
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:28,998
"Will you walk a little faster?"
Said a whiting to a snail.

1017
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:33,272
"There's a porpoise close behind
us, and he's treading on my tail,

1018
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:37,558
See how eagerly the lobsters
and the turtles all advance!

1019
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:41,957
They are waiting on the shingle.
Will you come and join the dance?

1020
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:05,318
See how eagerly the lobsters
and the turtles all advance!

1021
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:09,712
They are waiting on the shingle.
Will you come and join the dance?

1022
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:11,597
Dance!

1023
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:15,713
Will you, won't you, will you,
won't you, join the dance?

1024
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:16,357
Dance!

1025
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:21,468
Will you, won't you, will you,
won't you - join the dance?"

1026
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:22,709
Dance!

1027
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:28,359
Thank you. It was a very
interesting dance to watch.

1028
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:31,512
And no wise fish would ever go
anywhere without a porpoise.

1029
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,718
- Wouldn't it really?
- Course not.

1030
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:35,955
Why, if a fish came to me and
said he was going on a journey,

1031
01:21:36,040 --> 01:21:37,917
I'd say "with what porpoise?"

1032
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:39,839
So you like performing then?

1033
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:41,992
No... I hate it.

1034
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:44,315
Oh you know you mustn't it's such fun.

1035
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:45,270
Stand up.

1036
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:46,759
Oh you are standing up.

1037
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:49,837
Recite "Tis voice of the sluggard".

1038
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:51,035
She doesn't know that!

1039
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:52,030
I do.

1040
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:53,439
Recite it then!

1041
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:58,759
"Tis the voice of the Lobster
I heard him declare.

1042
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:00,756
You have baked me too
brown. I must sugar my hair

1043
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:04,031
As a duck with its eyelids,
so he with his nose.

1044
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:07,317
Trims his belt and his buttons
and turns out his toes"

1045
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:11,594
You've got it wrong.

1046
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:16,833
I keep getting things wrong today...

1047
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:20,788
I think you'd better sing "Turtle Soup" instead,

1048
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:22,472
if you would, Old Fellow.

1049
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:24,158
You don't have to ask me twice.

1050
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:25,519
He'll sing at the drop of a hat.

1051
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:27,790
I haven't got a hat, but if
I had and it dropped it,

1052
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:29,199
I'd sing before it touched the ground.

1053
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:31,589
You're in for a treat, Alice...

1054
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:37,437
Master... an undiscovered virtuose.

1055
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:42,196
And he plays the spoons...
show her your reviews.

1056
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:46,068
Later... Later, I'm in my
singing mode right now.

1057
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:56,390
"Beautiful Soup so rich and green,

1058
01:22:56,480 --> 01:23:02,555
Waiting in a hot tureen!

1059
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:09,472
Who for such dainties, would not stoop?

1060
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:13,718
Soup of the evening,

1061
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:17,236
Beautiful Soup!

1062
01:23:17,320 --> 01:23:26,069
Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!

1063
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:29,954
Beau-ootiful Soo-oop!

1064
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:32,998
Beau-ootiful Soo-oop!

1065
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:37,796
Soo-oop of the e-e-evening.

1066
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:45,873
Beau-ootiful, soo-oo... take it Alice!

1067
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:50,318
Soo-oop!

1068
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:52,954
Needs a little work, but we'll get it.

1069
01:23:54,320 --> 01:24:02,079
Beautiful Soup! Who cares for fish.

1070
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:07,678
Game or any other dish!

1071
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:12,112
Who would not give all else

1072
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:24,118
for two Pennyworth only of Beautiful Soup!

1073
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:27,829
Beau-ootiful Soo-oop!

1074
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:31,799
Beau-ootiful Soo-oop!

1075
01:24:31,880 --> 01:24:37,159
Soo-oop of the e-e-evening.

1076
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:52,355
Beau-oooo...

1077
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:58,669
...tiful soooo-oooop!"

1078
01:24:59,480 --> 01:25:04,270
And now my dear - I think
you're ready to find your way

1079
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:08,837
And they say this sort of
thing is only for the rich.

1080
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:11,510
One more chorus, dear fellow!

1081
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:16,515
Beau-ootiful Soo-oop!

1082
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:20,513
Beau-ootiful Soo-oop!

1083
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:25,435
Soo-oop of the e-e-evening.

1084
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:41,312
Beau-oooo...

1085
01:25:41,480 --> 01:25:46,508
...tiful soo-oop.

1086
01:25:51,320 --> 01:25:54,756
Beau-ootiful soup so...

1087
01:26:04,240 --> 01:26:05,878
Oh dear.

1088
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:07,911
I was forgetting...

1089
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:25,513
Ah, perhaps this is the way out.

1090
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:25,235
Ahoy! Ahoy! She's my prisoner, you know!

1091
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:27,151
And I've come to rescue her.

1092
01:27:27,240 --> 01:27:29,117
We'll have to fight for her.

1093
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:31,839
You'll observe the rules of battle, of course.

1094
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:33,831
I always do.

1095
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:35,069
Good man.

1096
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:46,672
Take that! Oh!

1097
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:09,037
Curse my weak wrists!

1098
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:11,555
You're worthy opponent, sir.

1099
01:28:11,640 --> 01:28:13,358
Another day perhaps?

1100
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:14,668
Another day, sir!

1101
01:28:38,680 --> 01:28:39,954
Thank you very much...

1102
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:43,112
That was a glorious victory, wasn't it?

1103
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:46,510
As an encore I do the Battle of Agincourt.

1104
01:28:46,640 --> 01:28:49,393
- Here let me help you take your helmet off.
- Yes...

1105
01:29:02,640 --> 01:29:06,952
Oh, I can breathe now.

1106
01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:12,709
Thank you.

1107
01:29:26,840 --> 01:29:29,593
I see you're admiring my box.

1108
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:32,997
It's my own invention to keep sandwiches in.

1109
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:37,835
You see I carry it upside-down so
they don't get wet when it rains.

1110
01:29:38,080 --> 01:29:41,709
But they can drop out, the lid is open.

1111
01:29:43,080 --> 01:29:46,675
So that's what happened to my sandwiches!

1112
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:04,712
Do you know why I did that?

1113
01:30:04,840 --> 01:30:05,909
No.

1114
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,672
It's now a bee's nest.

1115
01:30:08,200 --> 01:30:10,395
I should be getting some honey very soon.

1116
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:14,400
But you already have a bee-hive.

1117
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:16,357
Oh, one of the best...

1118
01:30:16,440 --> 01:30:18,351
but the bees won't come near it.

1119
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:19,708
Same with this.

1120
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:21,637
It's better mouse-trap.

1121
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:24,837
Come to think of it

1122
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:29,397
I shouldn't be surprised if the
mice don't keep the bees out...

1123
01:30:29,480 --> 01:30:32,631
or the bees keep the mice
out... one or the other.

1124
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:36,476
But why would you need a mouse-trap?

1125
01:30:36,520 --> 01:30:39,956
You won't find many mice running
around on the backs of horse's.

1126
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:44,835
But if there were he'd be
protected, wouldn't you old chap.

1127
01:30:51,320 --> 01:30:52,435
Are you alright?

1128
01:30:53,720 --> 01:30:57,030
I hope you've got your hair fastened on tight?

1129
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:01,509
Only in the usual way.

1130
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:04,991
Well, that's not good enough.

1131
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:09,634
The wind is as strong as soup around here.

1132
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:11,796
You must be ready for anything.

1133
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:14,235
Then nothing can frighten you.

1134
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:34,360
You don't seem to have much riding practice.

1135
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:35,913
What makes you say that?

1136
01:31:36,040 --> 01:31:37,678
You keep falling off your horse.

1137
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:40,439
I've had plenty of practice
at that... plenty of practice.

1138
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:42,438
Yes, I suppose you have.

1139
01:31:42,520 --> 01:31:44,875
The art of riding is to keep your balance.

1140
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:46,075
Hold this.

1141
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:47,350
What is it?

1142
01:31:47,480 --> 01:31:50,313
I forget but I know it was a bargain...

1143
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:56,153
Plenty of practice... plenty of practice...

1144
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:01,113
Mr Knight!

1145
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:25,232
You see, our bodies are driven by our legs

1146
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:28,312
and our legs are driven by our feet...

1147
01:32:28,440 --> 01:32:31,079
How can you go on talking
when you're like this?

1148
01:32:31,560 --> 01:32:32,788
Like what?

1149
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:35,798
Head-downwards and body in the air.

1150
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:41,876
What does it matter where
my body happens to be?

1151
01:32:41,960 --> 01:32:45,077
My mind goes on working just the same.

1152
01:32:45,160 --> 01:32:48,072
It's a hive of activity.

1153
01:32:48,160 --> 01:32:52,233
Ideas! Ideas! Ideas!

1154
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:56,996
In fact the more head-downwards I
am, the more I keep inventing things.

1155
01:32:57,080 --> 01:33:01,676
The cleverest thing I ever invented
I thought of head-downwards.

1156
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:03,193
And what was that?

1157
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:04,599
A new pudding.

1158
01:33:05,120 --> 01:33:07,839
Come to think of it, I don't believe
that pudding was ever cooked.

1159
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:11,075
Why, what was it made of?

1160
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:12,714
Blotting-pepper!

1161
01:33:13,320 --> 01:33:15,709
Uh, that wouldn't have been very nice.

1162
01:33:16,440 --> 01:33:18,158
Not very nice alone...

1163
01:33:18,240 --> 01:33:22,995
but mixing it with other things
like gunpowder and sealing wax

1164
01:33:23,080 --> 01:33:26,868
gives it a true taste of the Cordon-Bleus...

1165
01:33:29,320 --> 01:33:31,038
Now I must leave you.

1166
01:33:31,200 --> 01:33:35,876
I've still dragons to slay
and young ladies to rescue.

1167
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:40,354
You look worried. You're too young to worry.

1168
01:33:40,440 --> 01:33:42,874
Look at me I don't worry.

1169
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:47,511
Well, I was thinking about the things
I have to do when I go home...

1170
01:33:48,240 --> 01:33:49,753
You're going home?

1171
01:33:50,760 --> 01:33:53,957
I don't want to but perhaps I should.

1172
01:33:54,440 --> 01:33:59,719
Just be brave. And always
get back on your horse.

1173
01:34:01,320 --> 01:34:05,108
Just keep your balance at all times. Yes, yes.

1174
01:34:05,240 --> 01:34:07,754
Can you tell me the how
to get out of the forest?

1175
01:34:07,880 --> 01:34:09,393
Plenty of practice, pl-ahhh!

1176
01:34:09,480 --> 01:34:10,629
Before you go!

1177
01:34:10,720 --> 01:34:13,917
Good-bye! Just be brave!

1178
01:34:14,120 --> 01:34:15,269
Mr Knight!

1179
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:49,477
Oh, Tiger-lily,

1180
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:52,910
I wish you could talk so you could
tell me how to get out of this wood?

1181
01:34:53,040 --> 01:34:58,592
I can talk when there's
anybody worth talking to.

1182
01:34:59,480 --> 01:35:01,038
Can all flowers talk?

1183
01:35:01,160 --> 01:35:02,354
As well as you...

1184
01:35:02,440 --> 01:35:05,352
It isn't manner for us to speak first.

1185
01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:07,510
We were wondering if you'd speak.

1186
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:09,795
I thought your face had got some sense on it.

1187
01:35:09,880 --> 01:35:11,313
Not much, but some.

1188
01:35:11,400 --> 01:35:14,392
Hmm but the colouring's right.

1189
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:16,869
Oh, I don't care about her colour...

1190
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:20,549
If only her petals curled
more she'd be all right.

1191
01:35:20,760 --> 01:35:22,876
Aren't you frightened of growing out here,

1192
01:35:22,920 --> 01:35:24,876
with no-one to look after you?

1193
01:35:24,920 --> 01:35:28,549
There's plenty of trees. What
else are they good for?

1194
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:30,835
But what good are trees
when danger comes near?

1195
01:35:30,920 --> 01:35:33,309
They have a good bark.

1196
01:35:33,440 --> 01:35:36,079
You didn't know that did you?!

1197
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:38,391
Silence all of you!

1198
01:35:40,240 --> 01:35:43,516
They're only like that
because I can't get at them,

1199
01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:45,711
they're to close to the ground.

1200
01:35:50,120 --> 01:35:53,396
If you're not polite, I'll make you into a chain!

1201
01:35:55,800 --> 01:35:59,713
Daisies are worst of all,
next to Snap-Dragons.

1202
01:36:01,080 --> 01:36:04,038
How is it that all of you can talk so well?

1203
01:36:04,120 --> 01:36:07,874
I've been in lots of gardens and I've
never heard flowers talk before.

1204
01:36:07,960 --> 01:36:09,473
Feel the ground.

1205
01:36:13,880 --> 01:36:15,438
It's very hard.

1206
01:36:15,640 --> 01:36:19,792
Ah, in most gardens the
flower-beds are too soft,

1207
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:21,751
so the flowers are always asleep.

1208
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:24,559
I see... I never thought of that.

1209
01:36:24,640 --> 01:36:28,553
In my opinion, I doubt if you ever think at all.

1210
01:36:31,720 --> 01:36:34,314
Hold your tongue, all of you!

1211
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:36,038
Now which way out of the wood?

1212
01:36:36,360 --> 01:36:37,429
That way.

1213
01:36:38,120 --> 01:36:39,314
That way.

1214
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:41,994
Ere this way... that way!

1215
01:36:42,080 --> 01:36:44,116
Definitely that way.

1216
01:36:44,200 --> 01:36:48,079
That way! That way... er.

1217
01:36:48,120 --> 01:36:50,350
Over there! Don't step on us!

1218
01:37:15,560 --> 01:37:20,588
Look, we're standing still as waxworks.

1219
01:37:20,760 --> 01:37:22,352
And if you think we're waxworks

1220
01:37:22,440 --> 01:37:25,079
you should pay for the privilege of looking.

1221
01:37:25,720 --> 01:37:28,109
Wax-works aren't made to
be looked at for nothing.

1222
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:30,311
No-how!

1223
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:35,713
Contrariwise, if you think we're alive,
we ought to introduce ourselves.

1224
01:37:36,760 --> 01:37:41,959
I am Mr Tweedledum and
this is Mr Tweddledee.

1225
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:43,710
I'm Alice.

1226
01:37:45,320 --> 01:37:48,596
Does the name Veronica
Buff mean anything to you?

1227
01:37:48,640 --> 01:37:50,153
No, who is she?

1228
01:37:50,240 --> 01:37:53,277
I don't know but we're obviously
doing her a favour mentioning her.

1229
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:55,920
Do you think she'll be grateful
if she becomes famous?

1230
01:37:56,120 --> 01:37:57,348
No-how!

1231
01:37:58,400 --> 01:38:01,153
I was just thinking of that poem of you two.

1232
01:38:01,840 --> 01:38:03,831
"Tweedledum and Tweedledee.

1233
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:05,558
Agreed to have a battle.

1234
01:38:05,640 --> 01:38:08,108
For Tweedledum said Tweedledee

1235
01:38:08,200 --> 01:38:10,794
Had spoiled his nice new rattle.

1236
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:13,440
Just then flew down a monstrous crow.

1237
01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:15,556
As black as a tar-barrel.

1238
01:38:15,720 --> 01:38:17,790
Which frightened both the heroes so.

1239
01:38:17,880 --> 01:38:19,916
They quite forgot their quarrel.

1240
01:38:24,440 --> 01:38:26,158
There's no monstrous crow!

1241
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:28,789
You recited that poem very nicely.

1242
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:30,598
Congratters... but it isn't us,

1243
01:38:30,640 --> 01:38:31,834
No-how!

1244
01:38:31,920 --> 01:38:34,992
No it's another set of er
Tweedledums and Tweedledees.

1245
01:38:35,040 --> 01:38:38,635
Altogether completely different
people, the names are the same.

1246
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:40,956
Contrariwise, you began all wrong.

1247
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,673
Yes yes. After you said "I'm Alice",

1248
01:38:43,720 --> 01:38:46,632
you should've said "How
do-dee" and shake hands.

1249
01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:47,796
Da-daa,

1250
01:38:48,080 --> 01:38:50,275
Now shake!

1251
01:38:54,640 --> 01:38:56,153
Here we go round the mulberry bush,

1252
01:38:56,240 --> 01:38:57,832
the mulberry bush, the mulberry bush.

1253
01:38:57,920 --> 01:38:59,751
Here we go around the mulberry bush,

1254
01:38:59,800 --> 01:39:01,631
On a cold and frosty morning.

1255
01:39:05,160 --> 01:39:07,196
Twice around is enough for any dance!

1256
01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:09,431
I hope you're not too tried?

1257
01:39:10,240 --> 01:39:14,313
No way, no way. Thank you for asking.

1258
01:39:17,440 --> 01:39:22,309
As we began with poetry and
song, let's continue that way.

1259
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:25,119
I'm sorry I haven't the time.

1260
01:39:27,080 --> 01:39:30,117
Neither have we. We never carry a watch.

1261
01:39:30,240 --> 01:39:31,878
No-how!

1262
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:36,591
The poem's called "The
Walrus and the Carpenter".

1263
01:39:36,680 --> 01:39:37,749
You'll love it.

1264
01:39:41,360 --> 01:39:42,588
Da-daa!

1265
01:39:43,160 --> 01:39:44,479
You start brother mine.

1266
01:39:46,520 --> 01:39:48,988
The sun was shining on the sea.

1267
01:39:49,080 --> 01:39:50,638
Yes, yes, yes...

1268
01:39:50,760 --> 01:39:52,512
The Sun was shining on the sea.

1269
01:39:52,600 --> 01:39:54,192
Shining with all his might.

1270
01:39:54,280 --> 01:39:57,078
He did his very best to make
the billows smooth and bright.

1271
01:39:57,120 --> 01:39:59,759
And this was odd, because it
was the middle of the night.

1272
01:40:01,080 --> 01:40:04,993
The Walrus and the Carpenter
were walking close at hand.

1273
01:40:05,080 --> 01:40:08,914
They wept like anything to
see Such quantities of sand.

1274
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:12,390
If this were only cleared away...

1275
01:40:12,480 --> 01:40:14,357
It really would be grand!

1276
01:40:14,440 --> 01:40:18,479
If seven maids with seven
mops swept it for half a year,

1277
01:40:18,600 --> 01:40:22,912
do you suppose that they could get it clear?

1278
01:40:23,160 --> 01:40:25,151
I doubt it very much...

1279
01:40:25,680 --> 01:40:28,240
And he shed a bitter tear.

1280
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:36,909
Sorry!

1281
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:40,875
Hello!

1282
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:43,990
Oooo!

1283
01:40:45,680 --> 01:40:49,559
Oh Oysters, will you walk with us?

1284
01:40:49,720 --> 01:40:51,392
The Walrus did beseech.

1285
01:40:51,880 --> 01:40:56,715
A pleasant walk, a pleasant
talk along the briny beach.

1286
01:40:57,120 --> 01:41:02,592
But we cannot do with more
than four, to give a hand to each.

1287
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:05,917
The eldest Oyster looked at
him, but never a word he said.

1288
01:41:09,680 --> 01:41:13,150
Meaning to say he did not
choose to leave the oyster-bed.

1289
01:41:14,840 --> 01:41:18,799
But four young Oysters hurried
up, all eager for the treat.

1290
01:41:18,920 --> 01:41:21,036
Their coats were brushed,
their faces washed,

1291
01:41:21,120 --> 01:41:24,351
Their shoes were clean
and neat, and this was odd.

1292
01:41:24,400 --> 01:41:25,719
And why was that?

1293
01:41:25,800 --> 01:41:27,597
Because they hadn't any feet.

1294
01:41:29,480 --> 01:41:35,476
"The time has come", the Walrus
said, "to talk of many things."

1295
01:41:35,600 --> 01:41:39,070
Of shoes and ships and sealing wax.

1296
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:42,988
Of cabbages and king.

1297
01:41:43,480 --> 01:41:47,712
And why the sea is boiling hot,

1298
01:41:47,800 --> 01:41:51,839
And whether pigs have wings.

1299
01:41:52,520 --> 01:41:56,479
"Wait a bit!" the Oysters cried,
"before we have our chat."

1300
01:41:56,560 --> 01:42:00,189
For some of us are out of
breath, and all of us are fat.

1301
01:42:01,160 --> 01:42:03,151
There really is no hurry.

1302
01:42:03,280 --> 01:42:05,510
We thank you very much for that.

1303
01:42:05,640 --> 01:42:08,632
A slice of bread is what we chiefly need.

1304
01:42:08,720 --> 01:42:13,919
Pepper and vinegar besides
are very good indeed.

1305
01:42:14,040 --> 01:42:19,592
So if you're ready, Oysters
dear, we can begin to feed.

1306
01:42:20,280 --> 01:42:22,635
But not on us! Not on us!

1307
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:25,234
See we're turning a little blue.

1308
01:42:25,360 --> 01:42:29,672
After such kindness, that
would be a dismal thing to do!

1309
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:35,676
Yes, it was very kind of you to
come! And you're very nice

1310
01:42:35,760 --> 01:42:39,309
Give another slice, my
friend give us another slice.

1311
01:42:39,400 --> 01:42:43,359
I wish you were not quite so
deaf, I've had to ask you twice!

1312
01:42:44,440 --> 01:42:50,072
Well, it seems a shame I must
confess to play them such a trick.

1313
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:55,554
When we've brought them so far,
and made them trot so quick!

1314
01:42:56,960 --> 01:43:01,431
Look at this, oh look at this
The butter's spread too thick!

1315
01:43:02,320 --> 01:43:11,592
I weep for you, I really
do: I deeply sympathize

1316
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:16,118
With sobs and tears he sorted
out those of the largest size.

1317
01:43:16,200 --> 01:43:19,954
Holding his pocket handkerchief
before his streaming eyes.

1318
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:21,354
Oh Oysters,

1319
01:43:22,200 --> 01:43:25,590
I have to say, you've had a pleasant run!

1320
01:43:26,080 --> 01:43:28,230
Shall we be trotting home again!

1321
01:43:28,600 --> 01:43:31,160
But answer came there none.

1322
01:43:31,280 --> 01:43:33,840
And this was scarcely odd because

1323
01:43:34,080 --> 01:43:36,992
They'd eaten every one.

1324
01:43:39,880 --> 01:43:44,829
O woeful, weeping Walrus,
your tears are all a sham.

1325
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:48,919
You're greedier for oysters
than children are for jam.

1326
01:43:55,560 --> 01:43:56,834
So what's the verdict?

1327
01:43:58,520 --> 01:44:00,590
I like the Walrus best

1328
01:44:00,680 --> 01:44:03,638
because he did feel a
little sorry for the oysters.

1329
01:44:04,080 --> 01:44:07,311
Chaa! He ate more than Carpenter.

1330
01:44:07,720 --> 01:44:11,235
In that case I like Carpenter better...

1331
01:44:11,320 --> 01:44:13,709
if he didn't eat as many as Walrus.

1332
01:44:14,160 --> 01:44:15,752
He ate as many as he could get.

1333
01:44:16,080 --> 01:44:18,594
Then they're both very nasty characters...

1334
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:20,795
Duh!

1335
01:44:28,600 --> 01:44:30,272
Is that a lion or a tiger?

1336
01:44:31,080 --> 01:44:32,069
Worse!

1337
01:44:33,040 --> 01:44:33,836
What is it?

1338
01:44:34,120 --> 01:44:35,872
It was the Red King snoring.

1339
01:44:36,440 --> 01:44:39,238
Yes he's the King of Heart's
lazy, no-good brother.

1340
01:44:39,320 --> 01:44:40,753
Every family has one.

1341
01:44:40,840 --> 01:44:41,829
Except ours...

1342
01:44:41,960 --> 01:44:43,598
We've got two.

1343
01:44:44,360 --> 01:44:45,793
Come let's have a look at him.

1344
01:44:59,360 --> 01:45:01,396
He'll catch a cold lying there.

1345
01:45:01,640 --> 01:45:03,835
He won't mind, he's dreaming about you.

1346
01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:05,592
You're only a sort of thing in his dream.

1347
01:45:05,720 --> 01:45:08,917
Yes if he woke up now, you'd go out... puff!

1348
01:45:10,280 --> 01:45:11,474
I would not!

1349
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:15,195
Besides if I'm only a sort of thing in
his dream, then what are you two?!

1350
01:45:21,080 --> 01:45:21,910
I'm going!

1351
01:45:24,200 --> 01:45:25,758
Well, all's well that ends well.

1352
01:45:28,280 --> 01:45:30,032
What is that?!

1353
01:45:33,800 --> 01:45:34,915
It's your rattle.

1354
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,150
You left it in the grass!

1355
01:45:37,720 --> 01:45:38,994
It looks a bit battered.

1356
01:45:39,680 --> 01:45:42,672
Uh! It's spoilt!

1357
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,753
Don't get so upset about an old rattle.

1358
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:48,593
Old! It isn't old!

1359
01:45:48,840 --> 01:45:52,116
I bought yesterday. It's brand spanking new!

1360
01:45:54,320 --> 01:45:55,753
There's only one thing for it.

1361
01:45:57,240 --> 01:45:58,389
Get a new one.

1362
01:45:58,480 --> 01:46:00,118
Nothing so simple. No, no, no.

1363
01:46:00,160 --> 01:46:03,755
We have to fight for the
honour of the Tweedles.

1364
01:46:04,040 --> 01:46:04,950
Right!

1365
01:46:06,400 --> 01:46:11,428
Ned Tweedledum versus the superior
strength and skill of Fred Tweedledee.

1366
01:46:11,880 --> 01:46:13,996
Frankly it's a bitone-sided.

1367
01:46:14,040 --> 01:46:17,589
I know... I was an advisor
to the British Army. Wha!

1368
01:46:17,680 --> 01:46:20,035
I advised them not to take
him but they wouldn't listen.

1369
01:46:20,560 --> 01:46:22,790
This is fighting talk.

1370
01:46:27,720 --> 01:46:32,316
Urrrrxxx... knikk... grrrrrgninch... so is this!

1371
01:46:33,400 --> 01:46:38,190
She must help us dress for it...
amour... to protect our vital parts.

1372
01:46:43,240 --> 01:46:47,472
Whatever the outcome dear brother,
I shall remember you in my will.

1373
01:46:47,560 --> 01:46:51,838
No money of course, but I shall
write "I remember you Fred".

1374
01:46:52,360 --> 01:46:56,478
I appreciate the thought but
I'd rather have the cash, Ned.

1375
01:46:59,800 --> 01:47:01,518
Why are you only wearing one sock?

1376
01:47:02,160 --> 01:47:03,229
I'm trying to save money.

1377
01:47:04,920 --> 01:47:05,955
Do I look pale?

1378
01:47:06,920 --> 01:47:07,796
A little.

1379
01:47:07,960 --> 01:47:11,236
Generally of course I'm very brave
but today I have a headache.

1380
01:47:11,960 --> 01:47:14,679
And I've got a... a toothache...

1381
01:47:14,760 --> 01:47:16,239
Which makes us even!

1382
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:18,631
You'd better not fight today then.

1383
01:47:18,720 --> 01:47:21,598
Oh, we must have a bit
of a fight, it's expected

1384
01:47:22,080 --> 01:47:23,752
And all because of a rattle!

1385
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:26,593
Yes, well I wouldn't have
minded but it was brand new!

1386
01:47:26,760 --> 01:47:29,149
It seems a bit petty.

1387
01:47:29,240 --> 01:47:32,516
Yes, indeed! That's exactly
why it's so important.

1388
01:47:34,920 --> 01:47:36,672
Arrghh!

1389
01:48:16,840 --> 01:48:18,671
The Blues!

1390
01:48:18,760 --> 01:48:20,318
The Blues!

1391
01:48:55,200 --> 01:48:56,428
It's the crow!

1392
01:48:56,840 --> 01:48:59,274
The monstrous crow!

1393
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:27,998
Alice, you are hereby
and forewith summoned

1394
01:49:28,040 --> 01:49:30,759
to attend the trial of Sir
Jack, the Knave of Hearts.

1395
01:49:51,680 --> 01:49:52,954
How do I look?

1396
01:49:53,080 --> 01:49:55,389
Too early to say.

1397
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:12,433
Try it again on soprano-sax.

1398
01:50:29,160 --> 01:50:30,354
What are they doing?

1399
01:50:30,520 --> 01:50:33,876
They can't have anything to
write, the trial hasn't begun yet.

1400
01:50:33,960 --> 01:50:35,473
They're putting down their own names

1401
01:50:35,560 --> 01:50:38,472
in case they forget them
by the time the trial is over.

1402
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:41,558
Stupid things.

1403
01:50:42,600 --> 01:50:44,670
How do you spell stupid?

1404
01:50:44,920 --> 01:50:47,309
S-T-

1405
01:50:47,960 --> 01:50:48,995
What's after T?

1406
01:50:49,160 --> 01:50:52,869
Dinner! Is it dinner time?

1407
01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:54,313
It's dinner time!

1408
01:50:54,440 --> 01:50:55,634
No it isn't.

1409
01:50:56,760 --> 01:50:58,990
I was sure it was dinner time, my
stomach feels like my throat's been cut...

1410
01:50:59,080 --> 01:51:00,559
Silence in Court!

1411
01:51:08,520 --> 01:51:11,398
Quiet! Silent!

1412
01:51:17,400 --> 01:51:21,188
It's your own fault Cedric. You're too easy.

1413
01:51:21,320 --> 01:51:24,756
Chop off more heads. It's wonderful!

1414
01:51:24,920 --> 01:51:27,593
Chop, chop and there's blood everywhere...

1415
01:51:28,400 --> 01:51:30,470
It makes you proud to be Queen.

1416
01:51:31,160 --> 01:51:31,990
He missed!

1417
01:51:32,080 --> 01:51:35,152
Oh he did? Nevermind, I felt it anyway.

1418
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:37,191
I'm not going to be called, am I?

1419
01:51:37,320 --> 01:51:38,878
Called what?

1420
01:51:38,960 --> 01:51:42,077
I don't want to stand up in
front of all these people.

1421
01:51:42,160 --> 01:51:43,354
Why am I here?

1422
01:51:43,920 --> 01:51:46,878
To save Jack from a death worse than fate.

1423
01:51:49,040 --> 01:51:50,837
Clerk of the Court, read the accusation!

1424
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:56,592
The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts.

1425
01:51:56,640 --> 01:51:58,835
All on a summer day.

1426
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:02,390
The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts.

1427
01:52:02,480 --> 01:52:04,835
And took them right away...

1428
01:52:04,920 --> 01:52:06,319
Oh, I confess!

1429
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:07,469
I didn't do it!

1430
01:52:07,800 --> 01:52:10,951
And I'm glad, glad, glad I didn't do it!

1431
01:52:11,600 --> 01:52:15,957
And if I had my time again, I
probably still wouldn't do it.

1432
01:52:16,560 --> 01:52:19,120
Bang! An open and shut case.

1433
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:20,872
That can't be right!

1434
01:52:20,960 --> 01:52:22,552
Did you say something, Alice?

1435
01:52:22,640 --> 01:52:24,278
No.

1436
01:52:24,360 --> 01:52:25,475
I'm glad that's over.

1437
01:52:25,600 --> 01:52:29,036
Members of the jury,
twelve good pigs and true

1438
01:52:29,160 --> 01:52:32,197
you must retire and consider your verdict.

1439
01:52:32,360 --> 01:52:34,157
- Not yet!
- Why not?

1440
01:52:34,680 --> 01:52:37,035
There's a great deal more to
come before you can say that.

1441
01:52:37,800 --> 01:52:41,588
That's odd - not to say strange.

1442
01:52:42,040 --> 01:52:46,716
Gentlemen of the jury it's
obvious the accused is guilty.

1443
01:52:47,600 --> 01:52:52,390
Put aside the evidence and look at his face...

1444
01:52:52,760 --> 01:52:56,275
It is the face of a habitual criminal.

1445
01:52:56,360 --> 01:52:59,636
A hardened felon, a recalcitrant rogue...

1446
01:53:00,760 --> 01:53:02,398
What is it?

1447
01:53:02,480 --> 01:53:04,948
We're lawyers for the defence!

1448
01:53:05,080 --> 01:53:08,277
Oh, I... er... rest my case.

1449
01:53:08,520 --> 01:53:09,919
Call the first witness.

1450
01:53:10,040 --> 01:53:11,996
Call the first witness!

1451
01:53:12,200 --> 01:53:14,395
CALL the first witness!

1452
01:53:14,440 --> 01:53:16,317
Call the first witness!

1453
01:53:16,360 --> 01:53:18,157
Call the first witness!

1454
01:53:18,760 --> 01:53:20,398
Call the first witness!

1455
01:53:21,200 --> 01:53:23,191
Call the first witness!

1456
01:53:23,640 --> 01:53:26,074
Call the first witness!

1457
01:53:30,080 --> 01:53:30,751
Good day!

1458
01:53:30,960 --> 01:53:31,597
Good day!

1459
01:53:31,680 --> 01:53:32,829
Snap!

1460
01:53:33,880 --> 01:53:36,189
I'm sorry about bringing
these things in with me

1461
01:53:36,280 --> 01:53:39,397
but I hadn't quite finished
my tea when I was sent for.

1462
01:53:39,600 --> 01:53:41,431
He never finishes his tea.

1463
01:53:41,560 --> 01:53:45,473
It isn't healthy, all those cucumber
sandwiches. Look at his legs!

1464
01:53:45,800 --> 01:53:46,630
I can't.

1465
01:53:46,720 --> 01:53:47,835
That's what I mean!

1466
01:53:47,920 --> 01:53:50,070
He's got a case of "cucumber legs".

1467
01:53:50,160 --> 01:53:53,675
The worst I've ever seen and
I've seen a few in my time.

1468
01:53:53,800 --> 01:53:55,995
Well you're a fine one to talk tubby!

1469
01:53:56,080 --> 01:53:57,911
You ought to have finished tea.

1470
01:53:58,120 --> 01:53:59,519
What time did you start?

1471
01:53:59,600 --> 01:54:01,238
I'll have to ask Mr Hare.

1472
01:54:01,280 --> 01:54:02,190
Send for him...

1473
01:54:06,080 --> 01:54:07,195
I didn't finish the sentence.

1474
01:54:07,440 --> 01:54:10,671
- You haven't passed one yet, Your Majesty.
- Oh, that's right.

1475
01:54:10,880 --> 01:54:13,553
When did we start tea? Fourteenth, wasn't it?

1476
01:54:13,800 --> 01:54:14,789
Fifteenth.

1477
01:54:14,920 --> 01:54:15,989
Sixteenth.

1478
01:54:16,240 --> 01:54:17,753
Write that down.

1479
01:54:19,040 --> 01:54:21,600
Fourteen, fifteen and sixteen.

1480
01:54:22,680 --> 01:54:26,958
Fourteen, fifteen and sixteen.

1481
01:54:27,040 --> 01:54:34,549
Now, subtract, multiply, and
convert to grams and kilos.

1482
01:54:36,360 --> 01:54:38,191
What's the answer?

1483
01:54:39,920 --> 01:54:41,638
They're slow.

1484
01:54:41,760 --> 01:54:44,149
They should be able to do it in their heads.

1485
01:54:44,480 --> 01:54:46,232
Off with them.

1486
01:54:51,440 --> 01:54:54,238
That hat! Disrespect of this Court. Take it off!

1487
01:54:54,720 --> 01:54:56,870
And his head with it.

1488
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:58,797
I can't, Your Honour.

1489
01:54:58,920 --> 01:55:00,353
Why can't you take it off, pray?

1490
01:55:00,440 --> 01:55:01,475
It isn't mine.

1491
01:55:01,600 --> 01:55:03,272
Stolen!

1492
01:55:03,560 --> 01:55:05,278
Members of the Jury, write that down!

1493
01:55:07,080 --> 01:55:10,629
Stolen hat, one. This man
is a self-confessed thief

1494
01:55:12,040 --> 01:55:14,952
and he has the gall to come into
this court as a character witness!

1495
01:55:15,040 --> 01:55:16,712
The King seems very prejudiced.

1496
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:18,119
Oh thank you, Alice.

1497
01:55:18,160 --> 01:55:20,515
That's what makes me so
eminently qualified to be a judge.

1498
01:55:20,560 --> 01:55:21,390
Oh yes!

1499
01:55:21,480 --> 01:55:23,391
Don't I know you?

1500
01:55:27,040 --> 01:55:31,192
I sell hats. I've none of my own.

1501
01:55:31,240 --> 01:55:32,559
I'm um um a hatter.

1502
01:55:32,640 --> 01:55:35,359
Then why didn't you say so. That's
the first thing you should've said.

1503
01:55:40,600 --> 01:55:44,309
Now give us your evidence.

1504
01:55:45,400 --> 01:55:46,515
Don't be nervous...

1505
01:55:46,640 --> 01:55:47,755
Oh no no no...

1506
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:50,195
Or we'll execute you on the spot.

1507
01:55:55,760 --> 01:55:57,239
I'm not nervous.

1508
01:55:57,400 --> 01:55:59,755
I've nothing to hide.

1509
01:56:00,160 --> 01:56:02,355
Done my duty, served my country...

1510
01:56:02,480 --> 01:56:04,277
I do know you.

1511
01:56:06,080 --> 01:56:09,755
Didn't we meet in Biarritz in the summer
of '41? Or wasn't it Heidelberg?

1512
01:56:09,840 --> 01:56:11,034
Hatter! Your evidence!

1513
01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:13,396
He' s just making him more nervous.

1514
01:56:13,680 --> 01:56:15,352
Stay calm, Mr Hatter!

1515
01:56:15,920 --> 01:56:20,311
I'm a poor man, Your Honour,
and I haven't had my tea.

1516
01:56:20,680 --> 01:56:24,229
And what with the sandwiches getting
ruined after being eaten once...

1517
01:56:24,320 --> 01:56:26,151
and the twinkling of the tea cups...

1518
01:56:26,280 --> 01:56:27,395
Twinkling?

1519
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:29,590
You're the "Twinkler"!

1520
01:56:30,040 --> 01:56:36,593
I remember, you sang at my
concert "Twinkle, twinkle little..."

1521
01:56:38,520 --> 01:56:40,112
Twinkle, Twinkle little gnat.

1522
01:56:40,200 --> 01:56:41,792
How I wonder what you're at.

1523
01:56:41,840 --> 01:56:45,355
You are very small indeed
you can vanish up my sleeve.

1524
01:56:45,440 --> 01:56:47,078
Up my sleeve, up my sleeve.

1525
01:56:47,120 --> 01:56:52,319
You can vanish up my sleeve.

1526
01:57:00,640 --> 01:57:02,073
We don't do encores.

1527
01:57:02,200 --> 01:57:05,351
But we're available for
weddings and funerals.

1528
01:57:05,480 --> 01:57:11,589
You did sing at my concert.
But this was even worse!

1529
01:57:12,440 --> 01:57:14,431
I've been practicing!

1530
01:57:15,680 --> 01:57:19,229
It's an offence against all we hold dear.

1531
01:57:19,920 --> 01:57:26,519
Cedric, this man ruined my concert
just as he's ruining your trial!

1532
01:57:26,680 --> 01:57:28,716
Oh! Sire, I'm a poor man,

1533
01:57:28,800 --> 01:57:31,951
I stand before you full of
remorse and malnutrition.

1534
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:33,752
When Mr March Hare said...

1535
01:57:33,920 --> 01:57:34,909
I deny it!

1536
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:35,830
I object.

1537
01:57:35,880 --> 01:57:36,790
Objection denied.

1538
01:57:36,920 --> 01:57:37,796
Ask Dormouse.

1539
01:57:37,880 --> 01:57:38,995
Ask Dormouse what?

1540
01:57:39,040 --> 01:57:39,916
I can't remember.

1541
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,036
You must remember or I'll have you executed!

1542
01:57:42,280 --> 01:57:44,077
Stand your ground, Mr Hatter!

1543
01:57:45,080 --> 01:57:48,550
I'm a very poor man, Your Majesty.

1544
01:57:48,760 --> 01:57:50,751
And a very poor actor!

1545
01:57:50,880 --> 01:57:52,438
Ooooo.

1546
01:57:52,680 --> 01:57:54,033
Suppress that cheering.

1547
01:58:05,600 --> 01:58:08,194
If that's all you know, you may stand down.

1548
01:58:08,280 --> 01:58:10,874
Well I can't get down any
lower, I'm on the floor as it is.

1549
01:58:10,960 --> 01:58:11,836
You may go.

1550
01:58:11,920 --> 01:58:13,239
Would you like another chorus of "Twinkle"?

1551
01:58:13,280 --> 01:58:14,235
GO!

1552
01:58:15,080 --> 01:58:17,275
Take off his head outside!

1553
01:58:17,640 --> 01:58:18,834
Call the next witness.

1554
01:58:19,280 --> 01:58:20,269
What about me?

1555
01:58:20,360 --> 01:58:21,998
What about you?

1556
01:58:23,880 --> 01:58:25,632
I'm the accused.

1557
01:58:25,720 --> 01:58:28,359
All you do is call witnesses!

1558
01:58:28,440 --> 01:58:29,759
It's not fair.

1559
01:58:29,840 --> 01:58:31,876
I should have the most important part here.

1560
01:58:32,400 --> 01:58:34,960
I haven't said a word for pages and pages...

1561
01:58:35,440 --> 01:58:37,749
What did you want to say?

1562
01:58:38,080 --> 01:58:41,117
I'd just like you to know that
I have no need to steal.

1563
01:58:41,200 --> 01:58:44,237
I'm independently wealthy.

1564
01:58:44,320 --> 01:58:47,232
I've all the money I need for the rest of my life

1565
01:58:47,640 --> 01:58:50,108
provided I die by one
am tomorrow morning...

1566
01:58:56,200 --> 01:58:58,191
We'll try and arrange it.

1567
01:58:58,520 --> 01:59:00,511
Well, that's all right then.

1568
01:59:02,680 --> 01:59:04,318
Jack's an idiot.

1569
01:59:04,400 --> 01:59:05,753
He's your nephew.

1570
01:59:05,880 --> 01:59:08,269
Only on my Father's side.

1571
01:59:20,640 --> 01:59:22,835
That's my cook. How dare she!

1572
01:59:32,080 --> 01:59:33,513
Give your evidence.

1573
01:59:33,640 --> 01:59:34,629
Shan't!

1574
01:59:35,880 --> 01:59:37,029
Shan't?

1575
01:59:37,120 --> 01:59:38,838
Shan't... shan't!

1576
01:59:40,160 --> 01:59:40,956
What now?

1577
01:59:41,040 --> 01:59:43,759
Your worship must
cross-examine the witness.

1578
01:59:43,840 --> 01:59:46,673
- Oh must I?
- Be a man, Cedric.

1579
01:59:46,760 --> 01:59:48,398
Be a man!

1580
01:59:49,160 --> 01:59:50,878
Oh, very well.

1581
01:59:52,280 --> 01:59:53,793
What are the tarts made of?

1582
01:59:54,800 --> 01:59:59,749
Ere what about repeating
the question, kind sir?

1583
01:59:59,880 --> 02:00:02,997
I recognize your accent... Girton College?

1584
02:00:03,080 --> 02:00:05,548
No, I went to Oxford, Misses.

1585
02:00:05,600 --> 02:00:08,398
You poor devil, and what did you study?

1586
02:00:08,520 --> 02:00:11,239
Ow to speak like this!

1587
02:00:19,240 --> 02:00:21,834
The witness will answer the question.
What are the tarts made of?

1588
02:00:21,920 --> 02:00:23,558
Pepper, mostly.

1589
02:00:24,080 --> 02:00:25,195
Treacle.

1590
02:00:25,280 --> 02:00:26,315
What did he say?

1591
02:00:26,360 --> 02:00:27,634
Treacle!

1592
02:00:27,680 --> 02:00:29,159
That's Mr Dormouse!

1593
02:00:29,240 --> 02:00:32,198
He's no right to be here.
Off with his whiskers!

1594
02:00:32,280 --> 02:00:33,429
Call the next witness!

1595
02:00:33,520 --> 02:00:35,795
Call Alice!

1596
02:01:06,160 --> 02:01:07,195
I'm sorry.

1597
02:01:07,920 --> 02:01:09,638
What's the matter Alice?

1598
02:01:10,400 --> 02:01:12,994
I don't like being called up here like this.

1599
02:01:13,120 --> 02:01:15,588
I should like it, if it happened to me.

1600
02:01:15,680 --> 02:01:18,990
Yes, most people like being
the centre of attention.

1601
02:01:19,040 --> 02:01:24,637
Now, what do you know about
this business with the tarts?

1602
02:01:25,680 --> 02:01:27,352
Nothing whatsoever!

1603
02:01:28,080 --> 02:01:29,672
That's very important.

1604
02:01:29,760 --> 02:01:32,194
Unimportant, Your Majesty.

1605
02:01:32,320 --> 02:01:35,073
Unimportant, of course,
is what I mean to say...

1606
02:01:35,240 --> 02:01:36,878
Unimportant.

1607
02:01:38,920 --> 02:01:40,751
Unimportant.

1608
02:01:41,200 --> 02:01:42,679
Important.

1609
02:01:43,240 --> 02:01:44,958
Unimportant.

1610
02:01:45,040 --> 02:01:48,828
I've told you all I know. I'd like
to go back to my seat now.

1611
02:01:48,920 --> 02:01:51,798
We're moved by your plea, but I
am reminded of Rule Forty-Two:

1612
02:01:51,880 --> 02:01:55,714
All persons more than a mile
high have to leave Wonderland.

1613
02:01:55,800 --> 02:01:57,438
I'm not a mile high.

1614
02:01:57,520 --> 02:01:58,999
You are.

1615
02:01:59,080 --> 02:02:01,116
More like two miles high!

1616
02:02:01,160 --> 02:02:02,832
You just invented that rule.

1617
02:02:02,880 --> 02:02:04,472
It's the oldest rule in the book.

1618
02:02:04,600 --> 02:02:06,716
Then it should be Rule Number One!

1619
02:02:07,600 --> 02:02:11,149
Careful Cedric, they're taking over the Court,

1620
02:02:11,280 --> 02:02:14,078
especially that girl.

1621
02:02:15,200 --> 02:02:16,519
Punish somebody.

1622
02:02:16,760 --> 02:02:19,399
You've too much to say for yourself Alice.

1623
02:02:20,200 --> 02:02:23,749
Jury consider your verdict.

1624
02:02:23,880 --> 02:02:29,671
No! Sentence first, verdict after.

1625
02:02:29,760 --> 02:02:31,113
That's stupid!

1626
02:02:31,800 --> 02:02:33,711
Have a care, Alice!

1627
02:02:33,840 --> 02:02:36,195
I can't let you condemn an innocent man.

1628
02:02:36,320 --> 02:02:38,436
Why not? It happens all the time.

1629
02:02:38,760 --> 02:02:39,954
Off with her...

1630
02:02:40,040 --> 02:02:41,871
Don't keep shouting "Off with her head"

1631
02:02:41,920 --> 02:02:44,753
in case someone shouts "Off with yours".

1632
02:02:45,320 --> 02:02:48,790
You've lost your last chance of staying here.

1633
02:02:48,880 --> 02:02:51,917
It's back to the real world for you, young lady!

1634
02:02:51,960 --> 02:02:53,154
I don't care!

1635
02:02:53,360 --> 02:02:56,875
All the tarts are here so how could
the prisoner have stolen them?!

1636
02:02:56,960 --> 02:02:58,916
There is no crime!

1637
02:03:00,160 --> 02:03:03,470
Alice! Don't you care what people think?

1638
02:03:04,640 --> 02:03:06,153
Not when I'm right.

1639
02:03:06,280 --> 02:03:08,475
Are you so confident, young lady?

1640
02:03:08,560 --> 02:03:10,039
Yes I am.

1641
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:13,389
Yes I am confident!

1642
02:03:15,680 --> 02:03:18,956
Then you don't need us anymore.

1643
02:04:08,360 --> 02:04:09,509
Alice!

1644
02:04:10,600 --> 02:04:11,794
Alice!

1645
02:04:12,920 --> 02:04:14,194
I'm coming

1646
02:04:27,640 --> 02:04:29,756
I'm here, I'm here.

1647
02:04:29,800 --> 02:04:31,119
I'm back! Sorry, I'm late!

1648
02:04:31,160 --> 02:04:32,639
We were getting worried.

1649
02:04:38,560 --> 02:04:42,712
And now, our daughter,
Alice, is going to sing for us.

1650
02:04:54,800 --> 02:04:57,394
It's "Cherry Ripe" isn't it, dear?

1651
02:05:15,520 --> 02:05:16,635
No.

1652
02:05:19,400 --> 02:05:20,992
I've got a better one.

1653
02:05:22,720 --> 02:05:26,315
"Will You Walk A Little Faster
Said A Whiting To A Snail".

1654
02:05:26,840 --> 02:05:28,273
Are you sure, dear?

1655
02:05:28,360 --> 02:05:30,112
Yes, I'm sure.

1656
02:05:31,120 --> 02:05:36,797
"Will you walk a little faster?"
Said a whiting to a snail,

1657
02:05:36,880 --> 02:05:42,432
There's a porpoise close behind
us, and he's treading on my tail,

1658
02:05:42,480 --> 02:05:48,032
See how eagerly the lobster
and the turtles all advance!

1659
02:05:48,080 --> 02:05:53,359
They are waiting on the shingle.
Will you come and join the dance?

1660
02:05:53,400 --> 02:05:58,599
Will you won't you, will you,
won't you, join the dance?

1661
02:05:58,640 --> 02:06:04,954
Will you, won't you, will you,
won't you, join the dance?

1662
02:06:05,040 --> 02:06:13,630
Will you, won't you, will you,
won't you, join the dance?

1663
02:06:13,800 --> 02:06:15,358
Well done!

1664
02:06:16,160 --> 02:06:17,718
Enchanting!
