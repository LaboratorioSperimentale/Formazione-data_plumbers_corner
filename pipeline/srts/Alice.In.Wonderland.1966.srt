1
00:00:01,301 --> 00:00:02,871
(Pigeons cooing)

2
00:00:07,307 --> 00:00:11,016
There was a time when
meadow, grove, and stream

3
00:00:11,078 --> 00:00:13,684
The earth and every common sight

4
00:00:13,747 --> 00:00:16,956
To me did seem
Apparell'd in celestial light

5
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,588
The glory and the
freshness of a dream

6
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,819
(Muttering)

7
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:47,125
(Birdsong outside)

8
00:00:48,315 --> 00:00:50,761
(Muttering)

9
00:00:50,818 --> 00:00:52,923
(Tuts) Child.

10
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:55,489
Hold that then. Quickly.

11
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:57,593
(Birdsong)

12
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:00,605
(Mutters)

13
00:01:06,467 --> 00:01:08,674
just hold still.

14
00:01:09,703 --> 00:01:11,683
Put your hat on.

15
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,880
(Mutters)

16
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:22,493
It'll last all through the summer.

17
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:29,767
Run along.

18
00:01:30,524 --> 00:01:32,629
Run along.

19
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,769
(Birdsong)

20
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:58,086
(Shrill birdsong)

21
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,966
(Pigeons cooing)

22
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:24,656
(Insects chirping)

23
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:20,543
(Chirping continues)

24
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:31,684
(Insect buzzing)

25
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:40,824
(Insects buzzing)

26
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,173
(Insects chirping and buzzing)

27
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:06,558
(Buzzing stops)

28
00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:46,349
(Door squeaks)

29
00:05:52,486 --> 00:05:55,626
(Alice) How queer
everything is today!

30
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:59,666
I wonder if I've been
changed in the night?

31
00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:05,300
Let me think. Was I the same
when I got up this morning?

32
00:06:07,267 --> 00:06:10,942
I almost think I can remember
feeling a little different

33
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:24,128
But If I'm not the same, the next
question is, who in the world am I?

34
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:28,958
Ah, that's the great puzzle!

35
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:31,002
Who am I?

36
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:43,706
(Birdsong)

37
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:06,336
I'll try If I know all
the things I used to.

38
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:09,735
Let me see:

39
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:12,174
Four times five

40
00:07:12,232 --> 00:07:14,473
is...is twelve,

41
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:17,448
and four times six

42
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:20,007
is thirteen,

43
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:23,148
and four times seven is...

44
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:45,142
(Handle rattles)

45
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:23,904
Curiouser and curiouser!

46
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,849
(Sighing)

47
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:33,051
How doth the little crocodile
improve his shining tail

48
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:38,085
And pour the waters of the Nile
on every golden scale!

49
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:40,131
(Birdsong)

50
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:47,161
- (Whirring and creaking)
- (Gasps)

51
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:49,503
- (Birdsong)
- (Wind howls)

52
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,513
(Distorted voices)

53
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:20,835
I think the main problem
is how we all get dry.

54
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,202
(Others) Yes, yes.

55
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:26,438
If you'd all be quiet and listen to
me, I'll soon make you dry enough!

56
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:27,944
Yes, yes, yes.

57
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:29,708
- Are you ready?
- Yes, yes.

58
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:32,841
- Here is the driest thing that I know.
- Yes, yes.

59
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:37,946
- Silence all around, please.
- Yes, yes, yes.

60
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:42,653
William the Conqueror, whose
cause was favoured by the Pope,

61
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:46,630
was soon submitted to by
the English, who wanted leaders,

62
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:51,396
and were of late much accustomed
to usurpation and conquest

63
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:56,407
Edwin and Mortar, the earls
of Mercia and Northumbria...

64
00:09:56,463 --> 00:10:00,036
I have never been so bored in my life.

65
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,102
- Yes. Yes, yes.
- Yes, yes.

66
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:03,476
Did you speak!

67
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:05,982
- No, not a word.
- Yes, yes.

68
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:08,519
- I thought you did.
- Yes, yes, yes.

69
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:11,419
- I shall proceed.
- Yes, yes.

70
00:10:11,478 --> 00:10:17,360
Edwin and Mortar, the earls of Mercia
and Northumbria, soon declared for him...

71
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:18,919
- Ugh!
- Oh!

72
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:23,991
...And even Stigand, as the
patriotic archbishop of Canterbury,

73
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:30,269
found it advisable to go with Edgar
Atheling and offer William the crown.

74
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:34,745
While the country still reeled
under the shock of the conquest,

75
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:38,715
the conqueror followed it by
introducing the feudal system...

76
00:10:38,772 --> 00:10:41,514
- (Snoring)
- ...which was hardly a ray of sunshine...

77
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:44,453
- Agh!
- ...as it drove a coach and horses

78
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:48,288
through the middle of the
Anglo-Saxon politic as it was then.

79
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:49,850
Hm? Oh.

80
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:53,261
- How are you getting on now, my dear?
- Yes?

81
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:59,270
Oh, in that case, I move that this meeting
adjourn for more energetic measures,

82
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:03,205
and I think a good thing
would be to have a Caucus-race.

83
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,475
What's a Caucus-race?

84
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:08,138
Well, best way to explain it...

85
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:11,114
- (Church organ playing)
- ...is for us all to do it, hm?

86
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,173
Come along, come along!

87
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:15,879
- (Church organ playing)
- (Chatter)

88
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:32,426
(Choir singing hymn)

89
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,261
Uh!

90
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:09,273
This'll never do.

91
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:11,536
Come on, come on, come on!

92
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:14,010
Come on! Come on, come on!

93
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:17,680
Come along now, come along!

94
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:20,684
Off you go, that's it, that's it.

95
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,742
Come on now, come on!

96
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,263
(shouting)

97
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:47,975
(Squealing)

98
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:53,181
(Squeals and grunts)

99
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:14,295
- All right, the race is over!
- (Groans)

100
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,500
(Others) Who has won? Who has won?

101
00:13:17,564 --> 00:13:21,341
Everybody's won,
and everyone must have prizes.

102
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:26,180
Prizes... Prizes... Prizes... Prizes

103
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:28,515
Prizes.

104
00:13:28,575 --> 00:13:30,486
Prizes. . . Prizes

105
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:34,218
Prizes. . . Prizes

106
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:37,056
Who's to give the prizes?

107
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:39,995
- Why, she will, of course.
- Prizes.

108
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:43,296
- The prizes.
- Prizes. Prizes.

109
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:45,267
Prizes. Prizes.

110
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:49,104
Prizes. Prizes.

111
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:51,142
- Prizes. Prizes.
- Prizes.

112
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:54,535
- Prizes. Prizes.
- Prizes.

113
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:57,710
- Prizes. Prizes.
- Prizes.

114
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:00,114
- Prizes.
- Prizes.

115
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,084
She must have a prize
herself, of course.

116
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:11,219
Well, of course she must. Er... what
else have you got in your pocket, eh?

117
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:16,133
- Only a thimble.
- Oh, let me see.

118
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:18,533
Uh!

119
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:22,562
I beg your acceptance
of this elegant thimble

120
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:23,937
(Muted cheering)

121
00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:27,570
Perhaps you would care
to continue with your story.

122
00:14:28,635 --> 00:14:31,445
You obviously have
your own methods of drying off.

123
00:14:31,504 --> 00:14:34,576
I don't see why I should
waste my breath on it any more.

124
00:14:34,641 --> 00:14:37,281
- More story.
- More story.

125
00:14:38,311 --> 00:14:40,917
I'll do nothing of the sort.

126
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,324
What a pity he wouldn't stay!

127
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:48,190
Come along! Come along! We're late.

128
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:50,291
(Birdsong)

129
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:03,538
(Rabbit) Mary Ann. Mary Ann.

130
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:06,015
Fetch me my gloves this moment.

131
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:12,413
(Rustling)

132
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:16,390
Quickly. Quickly.

133
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:19,292
(Whispering)

134
00:15:34,193 --> 00:15:35,993
I'm sure I'm not Ada.

135
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:40,947
She's got long ringlets. My hair
doesn't go in ringlets at all.

136
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,777
And I'm sure I ain't be Mabel,

137
00:15:44,844 --> 00:15:49,054
because I know all sorts of things
and she knows nothing.

138
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:53,359
Besides, she's she and I'm...

139
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:57,762
Oh dear how puzzling it all is!

140
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:10,813
How doth the little crocodile
Improve his shining tall

141
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:13,976
And pour the waters of the Nile
On every golden scale!

142
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,919
How cheerfully he seems to grin
How neatly spread his claws

143
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,957
And welcome little fishes in
with gently smiling jaws!

144
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:22,151
(Sighs!)

145
00:16:23,216 --> 00:16:26,129
I must be Mabel after all.

146
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:29,860
Oh, I'll have to go and live
in that poky little house.

147
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:33,768
(Rabbit) Mary Ann, do you hear me?
Fatch me my gloves and fan.

148
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:38,307
I'll go round and get in the window.

149
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:40,310
(Animal groans)

150
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:42,778
(Whispering)

151
00:16:50,276 --> 00:16:53,689
And a barrelful
will do to begin with.

152
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:56,852
- (Whispering)
- A barrelful of what?

153
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:59,522
(Cries, growls and whispers)

154
00:17:03,656 --> 00:17:05,966
We must burn the house down.

155
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,528
(Violin plays scratchily)

156
00:17:29,949 --> 00:17:31,986
(Dog barking)

157
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,362
(Barking)

158
00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:42,203
(Barking continues)

159
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:46,166
(Alice gasping)

160
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,483
(Gasping)

161
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:01,616
Who are you? Who are you?

162
00:18:02,982 --> 00:18:05,121
(Tapping)

163
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:06,162
Who are you?

164
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:16,829
(He sighs)

165
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:19,206
(Door creeks)

166
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:25,143
Who are you?

167
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:29,416
Come on, don't just stand there.

168
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:31,284
Who are you?

169
00:18:31,344 --> 00:18:34,518
I'm afraid I don't
know just at the moment.

170
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,582
I know who I was when
I got up this morning,

171
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:40,096
but I think I've changed
several times since then

172
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,100
What do you mean by that exactly?

173
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,327
Explain yourself.

174
00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:48,702
Afraid I can't explain myself.

175
00:18:48,761 --> 00:18:51,207
I'm not myself, you see.

176
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:53,835
No, I don't see.

177
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,541
Well, I can't put it any
more clearly, I'm afraid,

178
00:18:56,542 --> 00:18:58,508
because I don't
understand it myself,

179
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:02,543
and it's very confusing
changing size so often.

180
00:19:03,543 --> 00:19:05,181
It's not at all.

181
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:12,160
Well, I imagine you'll feel a bit queer
when you change size, won't you?

182
00:19:12,218 --> 00:19:15,563
- Not a bit.
- Well, it feels very queer to me.

183
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:17,396
Who are you?

184
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:20,828
I think you ought to
tell me who you are first.

185
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:24,500
Why?

186
00:19:24,564 --> 00:19:26,942
(Stutters) Come back!

187
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,774
Come...

188
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:35,213
I have something important to say.

189
00:19:39,212 --> 00:19:40,714
Yes?

190
00:19:43,316 --> 00:19:45,296
Keep your temper.

191
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:47,228
Is that all?

192
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:50,266
No.

193
00:19:50,323 --> 00:19:52,303
(Clock ticking)

194
00:20:06,105 --> 00:20:07,709
So...

195
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:11,812
- you're thinking of changing, are you?
- I'm afraid I am.

196
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:14,824
You see, I can't remember
things I used to

197
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:17,657
and I can't stay the same size
for more than ten minutes together.

198
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:21,799
What sort of things?

199
00:20:21,854 --> 00:20:25,802
Well, I've tried to say How Doth The Little
Busy Bee, but it came out all different.

200
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,899
Very well.

201
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:31,737
Repeat...

202
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:34,209
You Are Old, Father William.

203
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:40,073
'You are old, Father William,'
the young man said...

204
00:20:40,139 --> 00:20:42,847
- (Clock ticking)
- 'And your hair has become very white

205
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:48,518
'And yet you incessantly stand on your head--
Do you think at your age it is right?'

206
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:50,527
- (Clock ticking)
- 'In my youth,' said the sage,

207
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,029
as he shook his gray locks...

208
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:56,259
- Um...
- (Clock ticking)

209
00:20:56,322 --> 00:20:58,598
Um...

210
00:20:58,658 --> 00:21:01,832
'In my youth,' said the sage,
as he shook his gray locks,

211
00:21:01,894 --> 00:21:04,966
- (I kept all my limbs very supple"
- (Clock ticking)

212
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:09,977
'By the use of this ointment--

213
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:16,041
'One shilling a box--
Allow me to sell you a couple?'

214
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,952
- (Clock ticking)
- 'You are old,' said the youth,

215
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:22,652
'and your jaws are too weak
For anything tougher than...

216
00:21:22,715 --> 00:21:25,218
- 'than suet;
- (Clock ticking)

217
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:33,634
'Do you think I can listen
all day to such stuff?'

218
00:21:35,261 --> 00:21:38,834
'Be off or I'll kick you downstairs!'

219
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:42,573
(Snorts) That's not quite right!

220
00:21:44,003 --> 00:21:46,449
I'm afraid some of the words
seem to have got altered.

221
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:50,817
No! It is wrong from beginning to end.

222
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:54,847
What...what size do you want to be?

223
00:21:54,914 --> 00:21:56,951
I'm not particular as to size.

224
00:21:57,016 --> 00:21:59,656
It's just that one doesn't like
changing so often, you know.

225
00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:02,199
No, I don't know.

226
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:06,669
- Are...are you happy now?
- Well, I'd like to be a little larger.

227
00:22:06,726 --> 00:22:10,765
Hm. Seems a very nice size to me.

228
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:14,972
- But I'm not used to it.
- Hm.

229
00:22:15,034 --> 00:22:19,676
- (Sighs) You'll get used to it in time.
- (Clock ticking)

230
00:22:19,739 --> 00:22:22,310
- (Hammering on door)
- (Shouting)

231
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:24,480
- (Shattering)
- (Laughter)

232
00:22:31,217 --> 00:22:33,561
You'll never make them people
hear in there, you see,

233
00:22:33,619 --> 00:22:36,566
cos they're...like they're making
too much noise themselves.

234
00:22:36,622 --> 00:22:39,364
I mean, you follow what I mean.
You can hear 'em.

235
00:22:39,425 --> 00:22:41,371
How am I to get in, then?

236
00:22:41,427 --> 00:22:43,703
Hm.

237
00:22:43,763 --> 00:22:47,540
- Hm!
- (Shouting continues)

238
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,045
(Shattering)

239
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:52,913
Hm!

240
00:22:52,972 --> 00:22:54,974
(Shattering)

241
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:56,486
Hm.

242
00:22:56,542 --> 00:23:01,548
Oh, excuse me. Something seems to be
cropping up in this area over here.

243
00:23:01,614 --> 00:23:07,121
An invitation from the Queen
for the Duchess to play croquet.

244
00:23:07,186 --> 00:23:09,132
Oh, let's have a look.

245
00:23:10,356 --> 00:23:12,267
This the one, then, is it?

246
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,929
Mm.

247
00:23:15,995 --> 00:23:18,373
Yes, right, then. Thank you.

248
00:23:18,431 --> 00:23:20,274
- (Grunts)
- (Smash)

249
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:24,144
Just, er...just sink quietly
out of sight for me, will you?

250
00:23:24,203 --> 00:23:25,910
(Shattering and laughter)

251
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:27,917
Yes.

252
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:30,214
- (Dog barks)
- (Shattering)

253
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:34,482
- Now, then. I'll tell you what I'll do.
- (Shattering)

254
00:23:34,547 --> 00:23:37,426
- (Wild laughter)
- Tell you what I'll do for you.

255
00:23:37,483 --> 00:23:41,260
Nothing. How's that?
Any good to you at all? Nothing?

256
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:44,164
I mean, I wouldn't be able to do
it straightaway, I'll say that

257
00:23:44,223 --> 00:23:46,533
I couldn't possibly do
it straightaway

258
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:49,436
'cause I got all these things
cropping up I have to deal with.

259
00:23:49,495 --> 00:23:52,066
I... Well, you saw just now.

260
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:54,077
- Something cropped up there.
- (Smash)

261
00:23:54,133 --> 00:23:57,876
And I get...the same type of thing
I get cropping up all the time, you see.

262
00:23:57,937 --> 00:24:00,508
So naturally I got my hands full.

263
00:24:00,573 --> 00:24:02,951
But If I was to do nothing for you...

264
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:05,955
I can't promise I could,
but If I was to do nothing for you,

265
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:08,385
I'd have to sort of find a time,
you see,

266
00:24:08,386 --> 00:24:11,154
when I could squeeze it in,
you see what I mean?

267
00:24:11,217 --> 00:24:15,893
- I think you're absolutely idiotic.
- Oh. Oh, well.

268
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:18,595
Maybe I am. Maybe I'm not

269
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:20,603
(Raised voices)

270
00:24:20,604 --> 00:24:21,604
(Water bubbling)
- (Cackling and shushing)

271
00:24:24,497 --> 00:24:26,602
(Baby gurgling)

272
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:32,043
(Baby gurgling)

273
00:24:38,878 --> 00:24:42,519
- (Baby gurgling)
- (Hums tune)

274
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:46,723
- Why does your cat look like that?
- It's a Cheshire cat, that's why.

275
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:48,355
(Chuckles)

276
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,400
Pig!

277
00:24:50,456 --> 00:24:52,163
I didn't know that
Cheshire cats looked like that

278
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:55,000
All of them can and most of them do.

279
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:58,803
- I don't know that any of them do.
- You don't know much and that's a fact.

280
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:00,571
(Gasping and wheezing)

281
00:25:00,633 --> 00:25:03,204
(Snorting)

282
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:05,271
(Sneezes)

283
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:08,250
(Baby gurgles)

284
00:25:08,307 --> 00:25:10,583
Oh dear, oh dear.

285
00:25:10,643 --> 00:25:12,748
(Granting and snorting)

286
00:25:12,812 --> 00:25:16,487
Oh! Oh! Here we go,
here we go, here we go.

287
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:18,825
- (Sneezes)
- Mind the baby!

288
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:20,761
(Baby cries)

289
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,857
If everybody minded their own business,

290
00:25:22,922 --> 00:25:26,563
the world would turn a
great deal faster than it does.

291
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:29,333
That wouldn't be a great advantage.

292
00:25:29,395 --> 00:25:32,968
The world turns on
its axis every 24 hours.

293
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:34,602
Oh-ho-ho!

294
00:25:34,667 --> 00:25:38,672
Don't bother me, I never could
abide figures Could I?

295
00:25:38,737 --> 00:25:40,876
- (He burbles)
- (Baby chuckles)

296
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:45,150
Speak roughly to your little boy
And beat him when he sneezes

297
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:48,191
He only does it to annoy
Because he knows it teases!

298
00:25:48,247 --> 00:25:49,692
(Baby cries)

299
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:53,787
' (Both) Wow! Wow! Wow!
' (Baby cries)

300
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:58,631
I speak severely to my boy
I beat him when he sneezes

301
00:25:58,691 --> 00:26:02,264
For he can thoroughly enjoy
The pepper when he pleases!

302
00:26:02,328 --> 00:26:06,037
- (Baby crying)
- (Both chant song)

303
00:26:06,098 --> 00:26:08,669
Wow, wow, wow, wow!

304
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:11,578
(Baby oinks)

305
00:26:13,005 --> 00:26:15,645
(Cook) Yes, yes

306
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:26,229
For he could thoroughly enjoy
The pepper If he pleases!

307
00:26:26,285 --> 00:26:30,358
(Cook) Yes, yes, yes,

308
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,527
Here, nurse him for a bit.

309
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,832
(Pig-like squeal)

310
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:47,210
(Piglet squeals)

311
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:52,112
Which way ought I to go from here?

312
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:57,521
(Whispers) That depends a great deal
on where you want to go to.

313
00:26:57,583 --> 00:26:59,927
I don't much care where.

314
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:02,989
(Whisper!) Then it doesn't
matter which way you go.

315
00:27:03,055 --> 00:27:05,467
So long as I get somewhere.

316
00:27:05,524 --> 00:27:09,165
(Whispers) Oh, you're sure to do that
if you only walk long enough.

317
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:15,675
What sort of people live about here?

318
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:20,410
(Whispers) in that direction is a Hatter
and in that direction lives a March Hare.

319
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,281
(Whispers) They're both mad.

320
00:27:22,341 --> 00:27:25,322
But I don't want to
go among mad people.

321
00:27:25,377 --> 00:27:28,688
(Whispers) Oh, you ain't help that
we're all mad here.

322
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:31,091
(Whispers) I'm mad. You're mad.

323
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:38,795
(Whispers) By-the-by, what became of
the baby? I'd nearly forgotten to ask.

324
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:41,896
It turned into a pig.

325
00:27:41,961 --> 00:27:43,998
(Whispers) Ha. I thought it would.

326
00:27:47,933 --> 00:27:50,607
(Whispers) Did you say pig, or fig?

327
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:52,649
I said pig-

328
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,477
(Birdsong)

329
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:00,919
(Bees buzzing)

330
00:28:17,496 --> 00:28:19,237
No room

331
00:28:19,298 --> 00:28:20,641
Oh.

332
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:23,737
- No room.
- No room. No room, no room

333
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:26,749
- There's no...
- No room!

334
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:28,876
No room. No, no, no room. No room

335
00:28:28,941 --> 00:28:30,579
- No room.
- There's no room.

336
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:33,818
- No room.
- There's no room.

337
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:36,655
- There's plenty of room.
- Oh. Oh.

338
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:39,855
- Have some wine.
- I don't see any wine.

339
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:42,956
- There isn't any.
- Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it.

340
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:46,696
It wasn't very civil of you
to sit down before you were invited.

341
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:48,500
I thought you did invite me,

342
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,439
and anyway, the table's laid
for a great deal more than three.

343
00:28:51,497 --> 00:28:54,376
Your, um...your...

344
00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:57,107
your hair, er...wants cutting

345
00:28:57,169 --> 00:28:59,615
You shouldn't make personal remarks.
It's very rude.

346
00:29:01,316 --> 00:29:04,916
Oh. Why is a raven like
a writing-desk, I wonder.

347
00:29:05,044 --> 00:29:08,651
(Alice) Oh, I'm glad you've begun asking
riddles. I think I can guess that one.

348
00:29:08,714 --> 00:29:11,786
Do you mean that
you can find the answer to it?

349
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:14,490
- (Alice) Exactly.
- Then you should say what you mean.

350
00:29:14,553 --> 00:29:17,830
(Alice) I do. At least, I mean what I say.

351
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:20,928
- It's the same thing, you know.
- It isn't the same thing a bit.

352
00:29:20,993 --> 00:29:24,096
You might as well say that I, er...
'I see what I eat'

353
00:29:24,097 --> 00:29:26,409
is the same thing as
'I eat what I see'!

354
00:29:26,465 --> 00:29:28,001
You might just as well say

355
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:31,775
that 'I like what I get'
is the same thing as 'I get what I like'!

356
00:29:31,837 --> 00:29:33,475
Yes.

357
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:35,883
You might as well say...

358
00:29:37,676 --> 00:29:44,025
'I sleep when I breathe' is the
same thing as 'I breathe when I sleep'!

359
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:48,326
- Oh, it is the same thing with you.
- (Chuckles)

360
00:29:48,387 --> 00:29:50,367
(Insects buzz)

361
00:30:12,077 --> 00:30:15,217
(yawning)

362
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:19,319
- Oh, what day of the month is it?
- I think it's the fourth.

363
00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:21,728
Oh! Ha-ha-ha!

364
00:30:21,787 --> 00:30:25,257
Two days wrong! I knew that butter
wouldn't be good for the works.

365
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:27,702
- (Insect buzzes)
- It was the best butter

366
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:31,036
Yes, but we must have got
some crumbs in with it or something.

367
00:30:31,096 --> 00:30:33,235
I told you not to use the bread-knife.

368
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:37,269
- It was the best butter.
- That's as maybe.

369
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:41,978
What a curious watch! It tells the day
of the month and not what time it is.

370
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:46,113
Of course it does, child.
Does your watch tell you what year it is?

371
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:49,159
Of course not. That's because
it's the same year for so long together.

372
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:52,855
Exactly! Well, it's just the same
with my watch. Oh!

373
00:30:52,918 --> 00:30:59,199
# When Adam and Eve were first deprived
of the golden hand by Heaven...

374
00:30:59,258 --> 00:31:02,432
Oh, the Dormouse is falling asleep again.

375
00:31:02,494 --> 00:31:06,465
- Have you guessed the riddle yet?
- No, I give up. What is the answer?

376
00:31:06,532 --> 00:31:09,843
I haven't the slightest idea.

377
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:11,847
Nor I.

378
00:31:11,904 --> 00:31:13,815
I think you might do
something better with your time

379
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:16,580
than waste it on riddles
that have no answers.

380
00:31:16,642 --> 00:31:21,318
If you knew Time as well as I do,
you wouldn't talk about it. It's him.

381
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,723
I don't know what you mean.

382
00:31:22,781 --> 00:31:27,730
Of course you don't! I dare say
you've never even spoken to Time!

383
00:31:27,786 --> 00:31:30,266
Perhaps not, but I know
I have to beat time when I learn music.

384
00:31:30,322 --> 00:31:32,495
Uh!

385
00:31:32,958 --> 00:31:36,132
Uh!

386
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:39,175
Ho-ho-ho-ho! That amounts for it!

387
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:41,233
He can't stand beating.

388
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,536
But if you keep on good terms with Time,

389
00:31:43,537 --> 00:31:46,045
he'll do anything with
a clock that you want.

390
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:49,446
For example, supposing it's
half past nine in the morning,

391
00:31:49,447 --> 00:31:51,315
you just whisper a hint to Time.

392
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:55,882
Around goes the clock and it's half past
one in the afternoon, time for dinner!

393
00:31:55,948 --> 00:31:58,519
I only wish it were.

394
00:31:58,583 --> 00:31:59,925
(Alice) Yes, it might be rather nice

395
00:31:59,926 --> 00:32:01,621
but then I wouldn't be
hungry for it, you know.

396
00:32:01,687 --> 00:32:04,149
Not at first, perhaps,
but you could keep it

397
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:06,397
at half past one for
as long as you like.

398
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:08,424
(Alice) Is that the way you manage?

399
00:32:08,425 --> 00:32:11,100
Oh, no, no, no, no.
We quarreled last March.

400
00:32:11,163 --> 00:32:14,667
Just before he went mad, you know.

401
00:32:14,733 --> 00:32:18,306
It was at a concert given by the
Queen of Hearts. I had to sing that song.

402
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:22,841
# Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!

403
00:32:22,908 --> 00:32:26,253
# How I wonder what you're at! #

404
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:28,052
You're familiar with it, doubtless?

405
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:30,389
- I've heard something like it.
- Yes, it goes on...

406
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:33,692
# Up above the world the world you

407
00:32:33,752 --> 00:32:37,325
- (Insect buzzes)
- # Like a tea tray in the sky

408
00:32:37,389 --> 00:32:41,701
# Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle...

409
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:45,902
Oh, well, I'd hardly
finished the first verse

410
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:48,783
when the Queen jumps up and bawls out,

411
00:32:48,784 --> 00:32:52,108
'He's murdering the Time!
Off with his head!'

412
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:55,708
- How dreadfully savage!
- Oh, yes, yes, yes!

413
00:32:55,774 --> 00:33:00,655
Ho-ho! And ever since then,
Time won't do a thing for me

414
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:03,955
It's always six O'clock now.

415
00:33:04,016 --> 00:33:06,223
(Alice) Is that the reason
why so many tea things are put out here?

416
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:08,764
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.

417
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,926
It's always...it's always teatime

418
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:17,565
and of course we don't get much time
to wash the things up between whiles.

419
00:33:17,629 --> 00:33:21,475
- So you keep moving round, I suppose.
- Oh, we keep...we keep moving round.

420
00:33:21,533 --> 00:33:23,410
Yes, yes, yes.

421
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:25,744
As the things get used up.

422
00:33:25,804 --> 00:33:27,681
What happens
when you get back to the beginning?

423
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:30,515
- Oh!
- Suppose we change the subject.

424
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:33,852
I'm getting dreadfully bored by this.

425
00:33:33,912 --> 00:33:37,655
- I vote the young lady tells us a story.
- Oh.

426
00:33:37,716 --> 00:33:40,720
- I'm afraid I don't know one.
- Oh.

427
00:33:40,786 --> 00:33:42,993
Then the Dormouse will.

428
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:51,671
I wasn't asleep. I heard every
word you fellows were saying.

429
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:53,266
Tell us a story!

430
00:33:53,332 --> 00:33:57,178
You'd better get on with it, otherwise
you'll fall asleep again before you're done.

431
00:33:57,235 --> 00:33:59,806
- (Insects buzz)
- Heh-heh-heh.

432
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:04,149
Once upon a time
there were three little sisters.

433
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:05,654
Oh, yes.

434
00:34:05,711 --> 00:34:11,423
They were named Elsie,
Lacie and Tillie...

435
00:34:11,483 --> 00:34:13,019
(Chuckles)

436
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,828
...and they lived at
the bottom of a well.

437
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:19,528
- What did they live on?
- Ah.

438
00:34:19,591 --> 00:34:22,538
(Insects buzz)

439
00:34:25,764 --> 00:34:30,713
- They lived on...treacle.
- They couldn't have done that, you know.

440
00:34:30,769 --> 00:34:33,272
- They'd have been ill.
- Aye, they were.

441
00:34:33,338 --> 00:34:35,579
Very, very ill.

442
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,950
But why did they live
at the bottom of a well?

443
00:34:38,009 --> 00:34:40,285
Oh.

444
00:34:40,345 --> 00:34:44,418
- Take some more tea.
- I've had nothing yet, so I can't take more.

445
00:34:44,483 --> 00:34:49,023
What you mean is you can't take less.
It's very easy to take more than nothing.

446
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:54,196
- Nobody asked for your opinion.
- Now who's making personal remarks, eh?

447
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:58,173
- (Chuckles)
- (Insects buzz)

448
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,538
Oh.

449
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:03,836
Why did they live at the bottom of a well?

450
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:09,112
- It was a treacle well.
- There's no such thing.

451
00:35:11,143 --> 00:35:15,057
If you cannot be civil,
you tell the story yourself.

452
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:19,061
I won't Interrupt again.
I dare say there may be one

453
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:21,188
Oh, Indeed!

454
00:35:23,555 --> 00:35:25,535
Well...

455
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:31,336
the three little sisters,
they were all learning to draw, you know.

456
00:35:31,396 --> 00:35:33,637
What did they draw?

457
00:35:33,699 --> 00:35:36,145
(Others) Treacle

458
00:35:36,201 --> 00:35:38,442
Oh.

459
00:35:40,172 --> 00:35:41,879
(Insects buzz)

460
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:49,648
I don't understand.
Where did they draw the treacle from?

461
00:35:49,715 --> 00:35:54,926
You draw water from a water well. You draw
treacle from a treacle well, eh, stupid?

462
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,795
But they were in the well.

463
00:35:58,857 --> 00:36:00,996
Well in.

464
00:36:01,059 --> 00:36:03,005
(Guffaws)

465
00:36:04,029 --> 00:36:06,066
(Chuckles)

466
00:36:06,131 --> 00:36:08,270
(Grunts)

467
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:14,574
Then they learnt to draw.

468
00:36:17,242 --> 00:36:22,316
And they always drew
something beginning with an M.

469
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:25,452
- Why an M?
- Why not?

470
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:28,623
(Insects buzz)

471
00:36:39,131 --> 00:36:42,044
Everything beginning with an M...

472
00:36:43,101 --> 00:36:45,604
such as Mousetraps,

473
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:48,576
Money,

474
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,745
Memory.

475
00:36:50,809 --> 00:36:52,914
And muchness.

476
00:36:54,813 --> 00:36:59,489
I bet you never saw anything
like the drawing of a muchness.

477
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:02,760
- Really, now you say it, I don't...
- Then you shouldn't talk.

478
00:37:02,821 --> 00:37:06,234
- (Insects buzz)
- Oh.

479
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:13,800
(Whispers) It's the stupidest
tea party I was ever at

480
00:37:13,865 --> 00:37:15,867
(Insect buzzes)

481
00:37:17,502 --> 00:37:19,573
Why are you painting those roses?

482
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:26,355
What's that? What's that?

483
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:30,382
Will you hold that book steady?
I can't see to paint.

484
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:33,657
- What are you doing it for?
- Doing it for?

485
00:37:33,718 --> 00:37:35,891
- Yes.
- Yes.

486
00:37:35,954 --> 00:37:38,764
Yes, what am I doing it for?

487
00:37:38,824 --> 00:37:41,668
Yes, well, that is the question, isn't it?

488
00:37:41,726 --> 00:37:45,640
Ah. You see? It's no good.

489
00:37:45,697 --> 00:37:48,177
It's all a problem of colour, you see.

490
00:37:48,233 --> 00:37:54,240
The, er...problem of these being coloured
white when red was what was asked for.

491
00:37:54,306 --> 00:37:57,014
- Who's to know?
- Oh! Oh, yes, that's good.

492
00:37:57,075 --> 00:37:58,748
Ha-ha-ha! Yes, I like that.

493
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:02,485
Ha-ha-ha! Yes, who's to know?
The Queen, that's who.

494
00:38:02,547 --> 00:38:04,891
The Queen doesn't miss a trick.

495
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:07,055
It doesn't look much
like a red rose to me.

496
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:10,725
Oh, well, perhaps you'd like
to have a go at it yourself, then.

497
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:13,360
Yes, perhaps you'd like to
have a go at it yourself.

498
00:38:13,425 --> 00:38:16,565
I think we can do without any
help from you, thank you very much...

499
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:18,539
- (Drumming)
- Look!

500
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:20,576
(Band plays)

501
00:38:21,733 --> 00:38:23,144
It's the Queen.

502
00:38:23,201 --> 00:38:25,078
(Band drowns out speed!)

503
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:25,236
(Sobs)

504
00:39:41,279 --> 00:39:43,623
Ah, yes. And who's this?

505
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:46,355
- Yes, who is this?
- Or perhaps I shouldn't ask.

506
00:39:46,418 --> 00:39:48,364
(Burbles)

507
00:39:49,421 --> 00:39:53,494
Idiot. Absolute idiot. You've
got an absolute idiot for a son.

508
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:55,697
Yes, but he's tall. He's very tall.

509
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,036
Come along, child, speak up.
What's your name?

510
00:39:58,096 --> 00:40:00,838
- My name is Alice.
- Ah. Oh.

511
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,481
- Er...
- And who are these?

512
00:40:05,537 --> 00:40:09,485
- Or perhaps I shouldn't ask.
- How should I know? It's no business of mine.

513
00:40:09,541 --> 00:40:11,487
You little hussy. Off with her head.

514
00:40:11,543 --> 00:40:13,545
Nonsense.

515
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:15,386
(Men sob)

516
00:40:15,447 --> 00:40:20,453
Ah, yes. And what have you been
doing here? Or perhaps I shouldn't ask.

517
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:22,225
Or perhaps I should.

518
00:40:22,287 --> 00:40:25,325
Ha-ha! Painting white roses red, hm?

519
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:28,597
Perhaps you have an explanation?

520
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:32,198
Well, ma'am,
it's by way of rectifying a mistake.

521
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:37,611
What I've always said is what the eye
don't see the heart don't grieve over.

522
00:40:37,669 --> 00:40:41,640
I think that's for me to judge.
Off with their heads.

523
00:40:41,706 --> 00:40:46,052
- (Drum roll)
- It's a very fine day.

524
00:40:46,111 --> 00:40:49,490
- Very. Where's the Duchess?
- She's under sentence of execution

525
00:40:49,547 --> 00:40:51,493
- What for?
- She boxed the Queen's ears. Whoops.

526
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:54,194
All right!

527
00:40:54,252 --> 00:40:56,254
Get in your places!

528
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:00,231
You heard what she said.

529
00:41:10,168 --> 00:41:12,546
(Hymn starts)

530
00:43:12,223 --> 00:43:14,703
- (Hymn fades)
- (Birdsong)

531
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:34,217
(Drums beating)

532
00:43:43,588 --> 00:43:46,660
(Drums drown out speech)

533
00:43:52,063 --> 00:43:53,804
(Chatter and laughter)

534
00:44:31,269 --> 00:44:33,249
(Laughter)

535
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:16,115
(Alice whispers) How are you getting on?

536
00:46:16,174 --> 00:46:18,381
I don't think they play at all fairly.

537
00:46:18,443 --> 00:46:20,150
How do you like the Queen?

538
00:46:20,211 --> 00:46:22,157
Not at all.

539
00:46:22,213 --> 00:46:23,658
(Trumpet fanfare)

540
00:46:23,715 --> 00:46:27,561
- Who are you talking to?
- It's a friend of mine.

541
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:29,291
I don't like the look of it at all.

542
00:46:29,353 --> 00:46:33,130
- A cat may look at a queen.
- Cats are allowed to do that.

543
00:46:33,191 --> 00:46:35,398
It must be removed. Executioner!

544
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:39,966
About that cat. I want
its head taken off. Right off.

545
00:46:40,031 --> 00:46:43,035
Yeah, well, you've got a problem
there, haven't you?

546
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:46,809
I mean, with regard to cutting off
a head, you got a real problem,

547
00:46:46,871 --> 00:46:49,283
unless there's a body
to cut it off from.

548
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:51,047
I mean, you see what I mean.

549
00:46:51,108 --> 00:46:56,456
Don't talk nonsense. Anything
that has a head can be beheaded.

550
00:46:56,514 --> 00:46:58,152
Anyway, who does it belong to?

551
00:46:58,216 --> 00:47:00,856
It belongs to the Duchess
and you'd better ask her about it.

552
00:47:00,918 --> 00:47:03,524
- Ha-ha.
- Oh.

553
00:47:13,764 --> 00:47:16,506
(Birdsong)

554
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:24,286
Oh! You can't think how glad I am
to see you, you dear old thing!

555
00:47:26,711 --> 00:47:31,023
You're thinking about something
and that makes you forget to talk.

556
00:47:31,082 --> 00:47:35,155
I can't remember the moral of that,
but I shall remember it in a moment

557
00:47:35,219 --> 00:47:36,926
Perhaps it hasn't got a moral

558
00:47:36,988 --> 00:47:43,030
Tut-tut! My dear child, everything's got
a moral, if only you can find it.

559
00:47:43,094 --> 00:47:45,267
The game seems to be
coming on much better now.

560
00:47:45,329 --> 00:47:48,139
Yes, it is. Yes, it is.

561
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:53,945
And the moral of it is... 'tis love,
'tis love makes the world go round.

562
00:47:54,005 --> 00:47:56,417
I thought it mas done by everybody
minding their own business.

563
00:47:56,474 --> 00:47:59,216
Oh! Well, yes.

564
00:47:59,277 --> 00:48:01,917
Well, it means much the same thing.

565
00:48:01,979 --> 00:48:03,322
And the moral of that is,

566
00:48:03,381 --> 00:48:07,659
take care of the sense and the
sounds will take care of themselves.

567
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:09,891
Oh, she's jolly fond of finding morals.

568
00:48:09,954 --> 00:48:12,935
I dare say you're wondering why
I don't put my arm round your waist.

569
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:18,565
Well, the reason is I'm doubtful
of the temper of your flamingo.

570
00:48:18,629 --> 00:48:20,267
I haven't got a flamingo any more.

571
00:48:20,331 --> 00:48:24,905
How true, how true!
Flamingos and mustard, both bite.

572
00:48:24,969 --> 00:48:30,112
And the moral of that is,
birds of a feather flock together!

573
00:48:30,174 --> 00:48:32,711
But mustard isn't a bird.

574
00:48:32,777 --> 00:48:38,090
Right as usual. You do have
a nice clear way of putting things.

575
00:48:38,149 --> 00:48:39,685
It's a mineral, I think.

576
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:44,460
Yes, of course it is, and there's a rather
large mustard mine quite near here.

577
00:48:44,522 --> 00:48:46,934
Ha-ha! And the moral of it is,

578
00:48:46,991 --> 00:48:50,837
the more there is of mine,
the less there is of yours.

579
00:48:50,895 --> 00:48:54,104
I know, it's a vegetable.
It doesn't look like one but it is.

580
00:48:54,165 --> 00:48:55,872
I quite agree with you.

581
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:59,676
And the moral of that is,
be what you'd seem to be.

582
00:48:59,737 --> 00:49:02,013
Or if you would like
it put more simply,

583
00:49:02,073 --> 00:49:05,213
never imagine yourself
not to be otherwise

584
00:49:05,276 --> 00:49:07,256
than what it would appear to others

585
00:49:07,311 --> 00:49:11,919
that what you were and what you
might have been is not otherwise...

586
00:49:11,983 --> 00:49:14,657
(Chuckles) ...than what you have been.

587
00:49:14,719 --> 00:49:17,666
I think I'd understand that a bit
better if I had it written down,

588
00:49:17,722 --> 00:49:20,430
and I'm afraid I can't quite
follow it as you say it.

589
00:49:20,491 --> 00:49:25,167
Oh! I could say much better
than that If I chose.

590
00:49:25,229 --> 00:49:28,073
Please don't trouble yourself
to say it any longer than that.

591
00:49:28,132 --> 00:49:32,239
Don't talk about trouble. I'll make you
a present of everything I've said as yet

592
00:49:32,303 --> 00:49:35,307
A cheap sort of present, I must say.

593
00:49:35,373 --> 00:49:38,183
- Thinking again?
- I have a right to think.

594
00:49:38,242 --> 00:49:42,622
About as much right as pigs have
to fly. And the moral...

595
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:45,024
(Applause in distance)

596
00:49:47,952 --> 00:49:51,331
Either you or your head must be off
in the next five minutes!

597
00:49:51,388 --> 00:49:53,425
Take your choice.

598
00:50:10,174 --> 00:50:14,088
She'll be the death of me.
Come on, let's get on with the game.

599
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:19,784
(Funeral march plays)

600
00:50:30,928 --> 00:50:33,101
Well, here we are.

601
00:50:33,164 --> 00:50:36,543
- What's happened to them?
- They're going to be executed.

602
00:50:36,601 --> 00:50:40,139
- What do you mean?
- They're going to have their heads taken off.

603
00:50:40,204 --> 00:50:43,674
- What, all of them?
- Yes, the whole lot.

604
00:50:43,741 --> 00:50:47,018
There's no point spoiling the ship
for a ha'p'orth of tar.

605
00:50:47,078 --> 00:50:50,082
- Have you seen the Mock Turtle?
- No, who's that?

606
00:50:50,147 --> 00:50:53,993
Hm, you'd better ask the Gryphon about
that. He would be able to let you know.

607
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:56,031
(Seagulls cry)

608
00:50:57,788 --> 00:51:02,669
That's just her fantasy.
She never executes anyone.

609
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:05,468
Ah, there he is.

610
00:51:05,529 --> 00:51:09,534
- What's he so sad about?
- That's just his fantasy.

611
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:12,479
He's got nothing
to be sad about, really.

612
00:51:22,413 --> 00:51:26,657
This young lady wants
to hear your life history.

613
00:51:27,718 --> 00:51:30,528
All right. I'll tell it to her.

614
00:51:31,555 --> 00:51:34,092
But don't speak a word till I finish.

615
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:51,045
But how can he finish
if he doesn't begin?

616
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:54,920
Shh. He's got to get into the mood.

617
00:52:07,091 --> 00:52:11,733
When we were little,
we all went to school in the sea.

618
00:52:11,796 --> 00:52:16,745
The master was an old turtle -
we used to call him Tortoise...

619
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,246
Why did you call him Tortoise
if he wasn't one?

620
00:52:19,303 --> 00:52:22,750
We called him Tortoise because he
taught us. Really, you are very dull.

621
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:26,015
Ashamed of you asking
such a simple question as that.

622
00:52:26,076 --> 00:52:28,317
We had the best of educations.

623
00:52:28,379 --> 00:52:31,223
In fact we went to school every day.

624
00:52:31,282 --> 00:52:34,058
I've been to a day school too.
It's nothing to be so proud about.

625
00:52:34,118 --> 00:52:37,463
- With extras?
- Yes, we learned French and music.

626
00:52:37,521 --> 00:52:39,432
And washing?

627
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:41,367
- Certainly not.
- Aha.

628
00:52:41,425 --> 00:52:44,099
Well, then, yours wasn't
really a good school.

629
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:49,096
At our school we always
had at the end of the bill,

630
00:52:49,097 --> 00:52:52,512
'music, French and washing...extra'

631
00:52:53,838 --> 00:52:57,650
But I couldn't afford to learn it.
I only took the regular course.

632
00:52:57,708 --> 00:52:59,210
What was that?

633
00:52:59,276 --> 00:53:01,347
Reeling and writhing,
of course, to begin with,

634
00:53:01,412 --> 00:53:03,824
and then there were the
different branches of Arithmetic,

635
00:53:03,881 --> 00:53:08,796
Ambition, Distraction,
Uglification and Derision.

636
00:53:08,853 --> 00:53:11,299
I never heard of Uglification before.

637
00:53:11,355 --> 00:53:14,165
Never heard of uglify?

638
00:53:14,225 --> 00:53:17,297
- You've heard of beautifying, I suppose?
- Yes.

639
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:18,897
Need I say more?

640
00:53:18,963 --> 00:53:22,877
Then there was Mystery,
ancient and modern,

641
00:53:22,933 --> 00:53:25,072
and then Drawling.

642
00:53:25,135 --> 00:53:28,912
That was with the Drawling master.
He used to come once a week.

643
00:53:28,972 --> 00:53:33,011
He taught us Drawling, Stretching,

644
00:53:33,077 --> 00:53:35,421
and Fainting in Coils.

645
00:53:35,479 --> 00:53:37,083
What was that like?

646
00:53:37,147 --> 00:53:39,787
I couldn't possibly show you myself.
I'm much too stiff.

647
00:53:39,850 --> 00:53:42,490
And he never learnt it.

648
00:53:42,553 --> 00:53:46,057
I hadn't time.
But I went to the Classical master.

649
00:53:46,123 --> 00:53:49,002
Mm, I never went to him.

650
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:52,905
He taught Laughing and Grief,
or so they said.

651
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:57,007
So he did, so he did.

652
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:10,654
- How many hours a day did you do lessons?
- Ten hours the first day.

653
00:54:10,714 --> 00:54:12,887
- Nine the second.
- And so on.

654
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:15,260
- How odd.
- Not odd at all.

655
00:54:15,319 --> 00:54:19,199
That's why they're called lessons,
because they lessen from day to day.

656
00:54:20,224 --> 00:54:22,795
Then the eleventh day
must have been a holiday.

657
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:24,271
So it was.

658
00:54:25,329 --> 00:54:27,434
So it was.

659
00:54:27,498 --> 00:54:29,603
But then how did you
manage on the 12th day?

660
00:54:29,667 --> 00:54:35,174
Oh, that's enough about lessons.
Tell her about the games.

661
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:38,082
Have you ever done
the Lobster Quadrille?

662
00:54:39,476 --> 00:54:41,922
No. What sort of a dance is that?

663
00:54:41,979 --> 00:54:44,789
Well, first you form
a line along the seashore.

664
00:54:44,848 --> 00:54:48,523
No, two lines. Then after you've cleared
the jellyfish out of the way...

665
00:54:48,586 --> 00:54:50,395
That generally takes some time.

666
00:54:50,454 --> 00:54:52,900
- ...you advance twice.
- Each with a lobster as a partner.

667
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:56,460
You advance twice, set to partners...

668
00:54:56,527 --> 00:54:59,633
Change lobsters and
retire in the same order.

669
00:55:01,031 --> 00:55:03,170
It must be a very pretty dance.

670
00:55:03,233 --> 00:55:07,045
- Would you like to hear some of it?
- Very much indeed.

671
00:55:07,104 --> 00:55:08,447
Well, we'll sing.

672
00:55:08,505 --> 00:55:11,247
Oh, you sing it.
I can't remember the words.

673
00:55:12,276 --> 00:55:17,919
# Will you walk a little faster?
Said the whiting to the snail.

674
00:55:17,982 --> 00:55:22,863
# There's a porpoise close behind me
And he's treading on my tail

675
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:26,732
# See how eagerly the lobsters
And the turtles all advance!

676
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:30,499
# They are waiting on the shingle
Won't you come and join the dance?

677
00:55:30,561 --> 00:55:34,236
# Will. you, won't you, will you, won't you
Will you join the dance?

678
00:55:34,698 --> 00:55:40,307
# Will you, won't you, will you, won't you
Won't you join the dance?

679
00:55:41,672 --> 00:55:46,519
# You can really have no notion
How delightful it will be

680
00:55:46,577 --> 00:55:50,616
# When they take us up and throw us
With the lobsters out to sea

681
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:52,888
# But the snail replied

682
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:55,191
# 'Too far, too far!'

683
00:55:55,252 --> 00:55:56,629
# And gave a look askance

684
00:55:56,687 --> 00:56:01,830
# Said he thanked the whiting kindly
But he would not join the dance

685
00:56:01,892 --> 00:56:05,362
# Would not, could not, could not, would not
Could not join the dance

686
00:56:05,429 --> 00:56:08,000
# Could not, would not...

687
00:56:08,065 --> 00:56:10,409
# Could not, would not

688
00:56:10,467 --> 00:56:14,108
# Would not join

689
00:56:14,171 --> 00:56:16,014
# The dance #

690
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:26,350
- (Seagulls cry)
- (Whispers) The trial's beginning.

691
00:56:28,052 --> 00:56:29,725
The trial's beginning.

692
00:56:29,787 --> 00:56:32,267
(Hymn begins)

693
00:56:39,096 --> 00:56:41,702
(Hymn continues)

694
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:12,233
(Hymn continues)

695
00:57:48,999 --> 00:57:51,036
(Cough)

696
00:57:51,101 --> 00:57:53,581
(Hymn continues)

697
00:58:29,606 --> 00:58:31,552
(Hymn ends)

698
00:58:32,876 --> 00:58:34,822
- Who are they?
- The jury.

699
00:58:34,878 --> 00:58:36,186
What are they doing?

700
00:58:36,246 --> 00:58:40,456
Taking down their names in case
they forget them before the trial ends.

701
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:42,622
- (Chicken ducking)
- Stupid things.

702
00:58:43,954 --> 00:58:46,093
- Oh! Oh! Oh!
- (Gavel bangs)

703
00:58:46,156 --> 00:58:48,966
- Silence in court!
- (Coughing)

704
00:58:49,026 --> 00:58:51,563
- (Chicken ducking)
- Read the accusation.

705
00:58:51,628 --> 00:58:54,336
The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,
All on a summer's day:

706
00:58:54,398 --> 00:58:58,574
The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts
And took them quite away!

707
00:58:58,635 --> 00:59:00,308
- (Chicken ducking)
- Consider your verdict.

708
00:59:00,371 --> 00:59:03,682
Not yet, not yet! There's
a great deal to do before that!

709
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:05,686
- (Chicken ducking)
- Is there? Oh, dear.

710
00:59:05,742 --> 00:59:08,052
Well, um...er...

711
00:59:08,111 --> 00:59:10,751
call the first witness.

712
00:59:12,116 --> 00:59:13,754
First witness.

713
00:59:13,817 --> 00:59:17,196
- (Chicken ducking)
- (Coughing)

714
00:59:17,254 --> 00:59:19,165
(Mad Hatter chuckles)

715
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:24,368
Good morning.

716
00:59:24,428 --> 00:59:25,736
Hello.

717
00:59:25,796 --> 00:59:27,332
(Chuckles)

718
00:59:32,269 --> 00:59:35,375
Come on, come on.

719
00:59:35,439 --> 00:59:37,180
Oh, yes.

720
00:59:37,241 --> 00:59:39,050
(Horse whinnies)

721
00:59:39,109 --> 00:59:41,453
Come on! Come along!

722
00:59:45,716 --> 00:59:47,627
(Horse whinnies)

723
00:59:55,559 --> 00:59:58,506
- (Mad Hatter laughing)
- (Horse whinnies)

724
00:59:58,562 --> 01:00:02,510
Oh, I beg your pardon, Your Majesty,
for bringing these along,

725
01:00:02,566 --> 01:00:07,572
but I hadn't quite finished my tea
when I was sent for.

726
01:00:07,638 --> 01:00:11,142
Well, you ought to have finished.
When did you begin?

727
01:00:11,208 --> 01:00:13,279
The, er...

728
01:00:13,343 --> 01:00:16,290
Let me see. I think it was the, er...

729
01:00:16,346 --> 01:00:19,793
- 14th of March
- 15th.

730
01:00:19,850 --> 01:00:21,989
- 16th?
- Yes.

731
01:00:22,052 --> 01:00:24,328
16th. Write that down.

732
01:00:24,388 --> 01:00:27,562
And take off your hat.

733
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:30,366
Ah...it, um...it...

734
01:00:30,427 --> 01:00:31,770
Oh, dear.

735
01:00:31,828 --> 01:00:34,399
It is...it isn't...it isn't mine.

736
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:36,466
- It's, er...
- (Clucking)

737
01:00:36,533 --> 01:00:37,841
Stolen, is it?

738
01:00:37,901 --> 01:00:39,972
No, no, no. I, er...

739
01:00:40,037 --> 01:00:42,540
I keep them to sell,
Your Majesty, you see.

740
01:00:42,606 --> 01:00:44,779
I'm a...I'm a hatter.

741
01:00:46,043 --> 01:00:49,320
- A very nervous hatter.
- Yes, I am, yes.

742
01:00:49,379 --> 01:00:51,120
- Well, don't be nervous.
- No.

743
01:00:51,181 --> 01:00:56,460
Don't be nervous. just give your evidence,
or I shall have you executed, you know.

744
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:59,057
I'm...I'm allowed to do that

745
01:00:59,123 --> 01:01:02,070
- I can have anyone executed.
- Yes, yes.

746
01:01:02,125 --> 01:01:03,763
I have the power...power.

747
01:01:03,827 --> 01:01:08,207
Ah...I'm a very poor man,
Your Majesty.

748
01:01:08,265 --> 01:01:11,371
And I hadn't begun my tea...

749
01:01:11,435 --> 01:01:13,779
well, not above a week or so,

750
01:01:13,837 --> 01:01:16,647
and what with the bread and butter
getting so thin...

751
01:01:16,707 --> 01:01:19,711
- (Chicken clucking)
- ...and the twinkling of tea, I...

752
01:01:19,776 --> 01:01:23,155
- Twinkling of the what?
- Er...it began with the tea.

753
01:01:23,213 --> 01:01:26,285
Oh! I know that.

754
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:29,797
I'm not a fool. I know that
twinkling begins with a T.

755
01:01:29,853 --> 01:01:33,062
- Oh.
- I'm not a complete idiot, am I?

756
01:01:33,123 --> 01:01:34,761
- (Clears throat)
- Go on, go on.

757
01:01:34,825 --> 01:01:38,967
Like I said, Your Majesty,
I'm a...I'm a poor man

758
01:01:39,029 --> 01:01:42,238
and, um...most things
twinkled after that.

759
01:01:42,299 --> 01:01:44,472
- I didn't.
- You did.

760
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:47,640
- I didn't. I deny it.
- He denies it.

761
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:50,310
- (Clucking)
- Leave out that part

762
01:01:50,374 --> 01:01:55,346
After that, I, er...
I cut some bread and butter and...

763
01:01:55,412 --> 01:01:56,789
And after that, what happened?

764
01:01:56,847 --> 01:02:00,294
Ah, that...that I can't remember.

765
01:02:00,350 --> 01:02:04,025
Yes, yes, well, you must remember it,
or I'll have to have you executed.

766
01:02:04,087 --> 01:02:07,364
I'm a...I'm a poor man, Your Majesty.

767
01:02:07,424 --> 01:02:10,701
You are a jolly poor
speaker, that's for sure.

768
01:02:10,761 --> 01:02:14,140
Get down, sit down
and stand clear away.

769
01:02:14,197 --> 01:02:17,235
(Chuckles) Oh, thank you.

770
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:19,974
God bless you, Your Majesty. Ha-ha-ha!

771
01:02:20,037 --> 01:02:22,984
- (Chicken clucking)
- (Mad Hatter chuckling)

772
01:02:24,641 --> 01:02:26,917
Excuse me.

773
01:02:26,977 --> 01:02:31,119
I do hope you manage
to get the funds to pay it.

774
01:02:31,181 --> 01:02:33,821
- (Chicken ducking)
- Next witness.

775
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:44,868
- Give your evidence.
- Shan't.

776
01:02:47,331 --> 01:02:51,143
Oh, well, that's
the end of that, then.

777
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:52,906
Aah!

778
01:02:52,969 --> 01:02:56,314
Your Majesty must cross-examine
this witness.

779
01:02:56,373 --> 01:02:58,410
- Must I?
- Yes.

780
01:02:58,475 --> 01:03:00,512
Oh.

781
01:03:03,313 --> 01:03:05,589
Oh.

782
01:03:05,649 --> 01:03:07,253
Thank you.

783
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:13,264
What are tarts made of?

784
01:03:13,323 --> 01:03:15,564
- Pepper mostly-
- (Snorts)

785
01:03:16,526 --> 01:03:19,063
Anything you want to add to that?

786
01:03:19,129 --> 01:03:20,574
Yes, go away-

787
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:23,440
Go away with the pepper-

788
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:25,946
Oh.

789
01:03:26,003 --> 01:03:31,282
- Next witness.
- No, don't let's have another witness.

790
01:03:31,341 --> 01:03:36,154
Let's have a...let's have a song.

791
01:03:36,213 --> 01:03:39,717
Come on, lads, give us a melody.
Come along now.

792
01:03:39,783 --> 01:03:42,923
We... We've all rehearsed.

793
01:03:42,986 --> 01:03:45,967
# And we'll all

794
01:03:46,022 --> 01:03:49,697
# Swing together

795
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:52,467
# Britain shall be saved

796
01:03:52,529 --> 01:03:55,840
# In all sorts of weather

797
01:03:55,899 --> 01:03:58,140
# Come what may

798
01:03:58,201 --> 01:04:01,739
# And we'll all swing together

799
01:04:01,805 --> 01:04:05,719
# With our bodies between our knees

800
01:04:05,775 --> 01:04:09,552
# Yes, we'll all swing together

801
01:04:09,612 --> 01:04:14,960
# With our bodies between our knees...

802
01:04:15,018 --> 01:04:17,396
- (Clucking)
- Ah.

803
01:04:17,454 --> 01:04:20,162
They don't reach verdicts
like that any more.

804
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:22,100
Oh dear.

805
01:04:22,159 --> 01:04:23,934
Right.

806
01:04:23,994 --> 01:04:25,974
Next witness.

807
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:28,437
Alice!

808
01:04:28,498 --> 01:04:32,708
Ah. What have you got
to say for yourself?

809
01:04:32,769 --> 01:04:34,407
Nothing.

810
01:04:34,471 --> 01:04:36,473
- Nothing?
- Nothing whatever.

811
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:38,246
Oh, that's very important

812
01:04:39,776 --> 01:04:42,985
(Whispers) Unimportant,
Your Majesty means, of course.

813
01:04:43,046 --> 01:04:44,855
Ah. Oh.

814
01:04:44,915 --> 01:04:49,796
Oh. I thought I meant important.
That's what I thought I meant.

815
01:04:51,087 --> 01:04:53,693
Ah. Oh.

816
01:04:56,660 --> 01:04:57,968
Oh.

817
01:04:58,862 --> 01:05:01,342
Oh.

818
01:05:01,398 --> 01:05:03,435
Ah.

819
01:05:05,635 --> 01:05:08,514
(snores)

820
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:10,812
(Hiccups)

821
01:05:10,874 --> 01:05:13,377
Ah.

822
01:05:13,443 --> 01:05:15,389
(Hums tune)

823
01:05:15,445 --> 01:05:17,925
(Snorts)

824
01:05:19,482 --> 01:05:21,359
(Animal roars)

825
01:05:21,418 --> 01:05:23,523
Ahh!

826
01:05:23,587 --> 01:05:26,932
Silence in court! Silence in court!

827
01:05:26,990 --> 01:05:28,594
(Cough)

828
01:05:28,658 --> 01:05:35,075
All persons more than a mile high
to leave, er...court!

829
01:05:35,632 --> 01:05:38,909
- I'm not a mile high.
- Yes, you are.

830
01:05:38,969 --> 01:05:41,142
Nearly two miles high.

831
01:05:41,204 --> 01:05:43,013
(Clucking)

832
01:05:43,073 --> 01:05:45,747
Consider your silences.

833
01:05:46,609 --> 01:05:48,179
Their verses.

834
01:05:48,245 --> 01:05:51,715
No, no, no, no!
There's more evidence to come yet.

835
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:53,488
This paper's just been picked up.

836
01:05:53,550 --> 01:05:56,360
- What's in it?
- I haven't opened it yet.

837
01:05:56,419 --> 01:05:59,366
But it seems to be a letter
written by the prisoner to somebody.

838
01:05:59,422 --> 01:06:01,902
Well, it must be that.

839
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:06,998
I mean, it can't just be written to nobody
I mean, you can't just write to nobody.

840
01:06:07,063 --> 01:06:09,907
I mean, If you did that all the time, the...

841
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:12,947
Well, I mean
the post office'd come to a standstill.

842
01:06:13,003 --> 01:06:15,005
I mean, you've got to have somebody...

843
01:06:15,071 --> 01:06:18,541
I mean, well...

844
01:06:18,608 --> 01:06:20,781
Well, it's not allowed.

845
01:06:20,844 --> 01:06:22,414
Who's it directed to?

846
01:06:22,479 --> 01:06:26,689
It isn't directed at all. In fact,
there's nothing written on the outside.

847
01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:28,457
(Coughing)

848
01:06:28,518 --> 01:06:32,967
It isn't a letter at all.
It's a set of verses.

849
01:06:33,023 --> 01:06:35,970
- Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?
- No, they're not.

850
01:06:36,026 --> 01:06:38,836
And that's the queerest thing about it.

851
01:06:38,895 --> 01:06:45,107
You've been imitating people's
hands and writings again.

852
01:06:45,168 --> 01:06:47,148
(Oinks) Please, Your Majesty.

853
01:06:48,238 --> 01:06:49,581
I didn't...

854
01:06:49,639 --> 01:06:52,279
(Oinks) ...write it.

855
01:06:52,342 --> 01:06:55,721
And I can... (Oinks)
...prove that I didn't.

856
01:06:55,779 --> 01:07:00,319
(Oinks) There's no name
signed at the end.

857
01:07:00,383 --> 01:07:03,159
(King of Hearts) Well, that
only makes the matter worse.

858
01:07:03,220 --> 01:07:04,858
You must have meant some mischief

859
01:07:04,921 --> 01:07:08,994
or else you would have signed
your name like an honest man.

860
01:07:09,059 --> 01:07:12,370
- (Queen of Hearts) That proves his guilt.
- It proves nothing of the sort.

861
01:07:12,428 --> 01:07:14,408
- Hold your tongue.
- I won't.

862
01:07:14,464 --> 01:07:18,002
- (Clucking)
- Off with her head! Off with her head!

863
01:07:18,068 --> 01:07:21,880
Off with her head! Off with her head!

864
01:07:22,238 --> 01:07:26,311
Off with her head! Off with her head!

865
01:07:26,376 --> 01:07:28,686
Off with her head!

866
01:07:28,745 --> 01:07:32,318
Off with her head! Off with her head!

867
01:07:33,717 --> 01:07:36,493
- (Birds screech!)
- (Church bell tolls)

868
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:07,853
It is not now as it has been of yore

869
01:08:07,918 --> 01:08:11,559
Turn wheresoe'er I may
by night or day

870
01:08:11,621 --> 01:08:16,036
The things which I have seen
I now can see no more
