00:25:22,285 --> 00:25:24,378
Dear,
this is serious.

552
00:25:24,454 --> 00:25:27,389
I simply must--
Oh, a garden!

553
00:25:27,457 --> 00:25:29,618
Perhaps if
I ate something,

554
00:25:29,692 --> 00:25:32,217
it would make me
smaller.

555
00:25:32,295 --> 00:25:33,193
Oow!

556
00:25:33,263 --> 00:25:34,560
Help!

557
00:25:34,631 --> 00:25:36,758
I must
eat something.

558
00:25:36,833 --> 00:25:40,234
Not me! You...
you...you barbarian!

559
00:25:40,303 --> 00:25:42,362
Help!

560
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,137
Monster!

561
00:25:46,643 --> 00:25:47,541
Help!

562
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:49,669
Ah! I'm late!

563
00:25:49,746 --> 00:25:52,738
I'm here!
I should be there!

564
00:25:52,816 --> 00:25:54,750
Have a match?

565
00:25:54,818 --> 00:25:56,285
Must go!
Good-bye!

566
00:25:56,352 --> 00:25:58,286
I'm late!

567
00:25:58,354 --> 00:25:59,878
Please wait!

568
00:25:59,956 --> 00:26:02,390
Do you
have a match?

569
00:26:02,459 --> 00:26:04,222
No. Sorry.
Mr. Rabbit!

570
00:26:04,294 --> 00:26:06,990
No cooperation.
No cooperation at all.

571
00:26:07,063 --> 00:26:09,224

monsters about.

572

Have to
carry on alone.

573
00:26:16,239 --> 00:26:17,638
Wait. Please!

574
00:26:17,707 --> 00:26:19,675
Just a minute!

575
00:26:19,742 --> 00:26:19,909
Oh, dear.

576
00:26:19,909 --> 00:26:21,103
Oh, dear.

577
00:26:21,177 --> 00:26:25,079
I'll never catch him
while I'm this small.

578
00:26:25,148 --> 00:26:26,342
Why...

579
00:26:26,416 --> 00:26:28,145
curious butterflies.

580
00:26:28,218 --> 00:26:30,686
You mean bread
and butterflies.

581
00:26:30,753 --> 00:26:32,345
Of course--mmm?

582
00:26:33,756 --> 00:26:35,724

A horsefly.

585
00:26:41,831 --> 00:26:45,232
I mean, uh...
a rocking horsefly.

586
00:26:45,301 --> 00:26:46,734
Naturally.

587
00:26:46,803 --> 00:26:50,295
I beg your pardon,
but did you...

588
00:26:50,373 --> 00:26:54,969
That' nonsense.
Flowers can't talk.

589
00:26:55,044 --> 00:26:57,877
But of course
we can talk, my dear.

590
00:26:57,947 --> 00:26:59,676
If there' anyone worth
talking to.

591
00:26:59,749 --> 00:27:01,842
Or about.
Ha ha!

592
00:27:01,918 --> 00:27:03,943

00:27:06,089 --> 00:27:08,557
Let' sing
<i>Tell It To the Tulips.</i>

595
00:27:08,625 --> 00:27:11,219
Or about
shy little violets.

596
00:27:11,294 --> 00:27:14,161

are you from?

649

I don't come
from any garden.

a wildflower!

I'm not a wildflower.

00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:21,983
What specie or genus
are you, my dear?

653
00:30:22,051 --> 00:30:27,353
I suppose you'd call
me a genus humanus Alice.

654
00:30:27,423 --> 00:30:30,859
Ever see an Alice with
a blossom like that?

see an Alice?

Did you notice
her petals?

color.

at those stems!

I'd say.

she' pretty.

00:42:32,714 --> 00:42:34,739
No room!
No room!

924
00:42:34,816 --> 00:42:37,614
But there'
plenty of room.

925
00:42:37,685 --> 00:42:41,121
It' rude to sit
without being invited.

926
00:42:41,189 --> 00:42:44,647
It' very, very
rude, indeed!

927
00:42:44,726 --> 00:42:47,559
Very, very, very
rude, indeed.

928
00:42:47,629 --> 00:42:49,119
I'm very sorry.

929
00:42:49,197 --> 00:42:52,132
But I did enjoy
your singing.

930
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,395
You enjoyed
<i>our</i> singing?

931
00:42:54,469 --> 00:42:56,960
Oh, what
a delightful child!

932
00:42:57,038 --> 00:42:57,970
I'm so excited.

933
00:42:58,039 --> 00:42:59,802
We never get
compliments.

934
00:42:59,874 --> 00:43:02,809
You must have
a cup of tea!

935
00:43:02,877 --> 00:43:04,401
Ah, yes, indeed.

936
00:43:04,479 --> 00:43:07,937
You must have
a cup of tea.

937
00:43:08,016 --> 00:43:11,417
I'm sorry I interrupted
your birthday party.

938
00:43:11,486 --> 00:43:12,919
Birthday?

939
00:43:12,987 --> 00:43:15,751
This is not
a birthday party!

940
00:43:15,823 --> 00:43:17,313
Of course not.

941
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:21,595
This is
an unbirthday party.

942
00:43:21,663 --> 00:43:23,096
Unbirthday?

943
00:43:23,164 --> 00:43:25,598
I'm sorry.
I don't understand.

944
00:43:25,667 --> 00:43:27,100
It' very simple.

945
00:43:27,168 --> 00:43:29,102
30 days have Sept--

946
00:43:29,170 --> 00:43:30,603
No. An unbirthday...

Ha ha ha ha!

951
00:43:42,016 --> 00:43:43,506

Up above
the world you fly,

975
00:44:49,851 --> 00:44:52,786
Like a tea-tray
in the sky.

976
00:44:52,854 --> 00:44:55,152
That was lovely.

977
00:44:55,223 --> 00:44:57,350
And now, my dear,

978
00:44:57,425 --> 00:45:01,054
you were saying
you were seeking...

979
00:45:01,129 --> 00:45:02,596
Pardon me.

980
00:45:02,663 --> 00:45:06,793
You were seeking
some information of some kind?

981
00:45:06,868 --> 00:45:09,063
Yes. I'm looking
for--

982
00:45:09,137 --> 00:45:11,037
Clean cup!
Clean cup!

983
00:45:11,105 --> 00:45:12,595
Move down!

984
00:45:12,673 --> 00:45:14,698
But I haven't
used my cup.

985
00:45:14,776 --> 00:45:17,438

986
00:45:17,512 --> 00:45:20,208
Would you like
more tea?

987
00:45:20,281 --> 00:45:22,613
I haven't
had any yet,

988
00:45:22,683 --> 00:45:25,083
So I can't take more.

989
00:45:25,153 --> 00:45:27,451
You mean you
can't take less.

990
00:45:27,522 --> 00:45:30,719
You can always take
more than nothing.

991
00:45:30,792 --> 00:45:32,657
But--

992
00:45:32,727 --> 00:45:34,627
And now, my dear,

993
00:45:34,695 --> 00:45:37,630
Something seems
to be troubling you.

994
00:45:37,698 --> 00:45:40,394
Tell us
all about it.

995
00:45:40,468 --> 00:45:42,231
Start at
the beginning.

996
00:45:42,303 --> 00:45:43,600
Yes, yes.

997
00:45:43,671 --> 00:45:46,970
And when you
come to the end...

998
00:45:47,041 --> 00:45:48,508
stop!

999
00:45:48,576 --> 00:45:51,636
It started while
I was sitting...

1000
00:45:51,712 --> 00:45:53,907
on the riverbank
with Dinah.

1001
00:45:53,981 --> 00:45:55,608
Very interesting.

1002
00:45:55,683 --> 00:45:57,583
Who' Dinah?

1003
00:45:57,652 --> 00:45:59,779
Dinah' my cat.

1004
00:45:59,854 --> 00:46:00,821
Cat?

1005
00:46:00,888 --> 00:46:02,446
Cat!

1006
00:46:02,523 --> 00:46:04,684
What' got
into him?

1007
00:46:04,759 --> 00:46:05,919
Catch him!

1008
00:46:05,993 --> 00:46:08,427
Help! Help!
Stop him!

1009
00:46:08,496 --> 00:46:10,123
Get the jam!

1010
00:46:10,198 --> 00:46:11,825
Put it
on his nose!

1011
00:46:11,899 --> 00:46:13,799
C-c-cat...

1012
00:46:13,868 --> 00:46:14,800
Ohh...

1013
00:46:14,869 --> 00:46:16,461
Oh, my goodness.

1014
00:46:16,537 --> 00:46:20,496
Those are the things
that upset me.

1015
00:46:20,575 --> 00:46:23,271
See the trouble
you've started?

1016
00:46:23,344 --> 00:46:24,834
I didn't think--

1017
00:46:24,912 --> 00:46:28,143
If you don't think,
you shouldn't talk.

1018
00:46:28,216 --> 00:46:30,184
Clean cup,
move down!

1019
00:46:30,251 --> 00:46:31,218
But--

1020
00:46:31,285 --> 00:46:32,411
♪ Move down,
move down ♪

1021
00:46:32,487 --> 00:46:34,455
♪ Move down ♪

1022
00:46:34,522 --> 00:46:37,013
Now, dear,
you were saying?

1023
00:46:37,091 --> 00:46:38,524
Oh, yes.

1024
00:46:38,593 --> 00:46:41,357
I was sitting
on the riverbank,

1025
00:46:41,429 --> 00:46:43,556
with, uh...
you know who.

1026
00:46:43,631 --> 00:46:45,656
I do?

1027
00:46:45,733 --> 00:46:49,669
I mean my c-a-t.

1028
00:46:49,737 --> 00:46:50,897
Tea!

1029
00:46:52,273 --> 00:46:55,174
Just a half
a cup.

1030
00:46:55,243 --> 00:46:56,574
Come, come, my dear,

1031
00:46:56,644 --> 00:46:59,875
don't you care
for tea?

1032
00:46:59,947 --> 00:47:02,108
I'm very fond
of tea.

1033
00:47:02,183 --> 00:47:05,584
You could
at least make polite conversation.

1034
00:47:05,653 --> 00:47:07,348
I've been
trying to ask--

1035
00:47:07,421 --> 00:47:10,219
I have an
excellent idea.

1036
00:47:10,291 --> 00:47:12,486
Let' change
the subject.

1037
00:47:13,828 --> 00:47:17,491
Why is a raven
like a writing desk?

1038
00:47:17,565 --> 00:47:18,964
Riddles?

1039
00:47:19,033 --> 00:47:20,967
Let me see, now.

1040
00:47:21,035 --> 00:47:23,970
Why is a raven...

1041
00:47:24,038 --> 00:47:25,972
like a writing desk?

1042
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:27,507
I beg your pardon?

1043
00:47:27,575 --> 00:47:30,908
Why is a raven
like a writing desk?

1044
00:47:30,978 --> 00:47:32,070
What?

1045
00:47:32,146 --> 00:47:33,374
Careful.
She' mad.

1046
00:47:33,447 --> 00:47:35,915
It' your
silly riddle.

1047
00:47:35,983 --> 00:47:37,177
You just said--

1048
00:47:37,251 --> 00:47:38,741
Don't get excited.

1049
00:47:38,819 --> 00:47:39,877
A cup of tea?

1050
00:47:39,954 --> 00:47:43,253
A cup of tea,
indeed!

1051
00:47:43,324 --> 00:47:44,723
I haven't time.

1052
00:47:44,792 --> 00:47:44,859
The time!
Who' got the time?

1053
00:47:44,859 --> 00:47:47,726
The time!
Who' got the time?

1054
00:47:47,795 --> 00:47:50,263
No time,
no time, no time.

1055
00:47:50,331 --> 00:47:52,424
Hello. Good-bye.
I'm late! I'm late!

1056
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:53,797
The white rabbit!

1057
00:47:53,868 --> 00:47:56,428
I'm so late.
I'm so very late.

1058
00:47:56,537 --> 00:47:58,596
No wonder you're late.

1059
00:47:58,639 --> 00:48:01,938
This clock is exactly
two days slow.

1060
00:48:02,009 --> 00:48:03,499
Two days slow?

1061
00:48:03,578 --> 00:48:05,011
Of course you're late.

1062
00:48:05,079 --> 00:48:06,512
My goodness.

1063
00:48:06,581 --> 00:48:08,776
We'll have
to look into this.

1064
00:48:08,849 --> 00:48:10,749
A-ha!

1065
00:48:10,818 --> 00:48:12,683
I see what' wrong.

1066
00:48:12,753 --> 00:48:15,449
This watch
is full of wheels.

1067
00:48:15,523 --> 00:48:17,081
Oh, my poor watch.

1068
00:48:17,158 --> 00:48:19,683
Oh, my wheels
and springs.

1069
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,421
But-but-but-but...

1070
00:48:21,495 --> 00:48:23,258
Butter! Of course!

1071
00:48:23,331 --> 00:48:25,128
It needs butter.
Butter!

1072
00:48:25,199 --> 00:48:26,791
Butter!

1073
00:48:26,867 --> 00:48:28,095
But-butter?

1074
00:48:28,169 --> 00:48:29,966
Butter.
Thank you. Butter.

1075
00:48:30,037 --> 00:48:32,005
That' fine.

1076
00:48:32,073 --> 00:48:33,165
No, no, no.

1077
00:48:33,241 --> 00:48:35,709
You'll get
crumbs in it!

1078
00:48:35,776 --> 00:48:37,505
This is good butter.

1079
00:48:37,578 --> 00:48:38,840
Tea?

1080
00:48:38,913 --> 00:48:41,507
I never
thought of tea.

1081
00:48:41,582 --> 00:48:43,049
No! Not tea!

1082
00:48:43,117 --> 00:48:44,209
Sugar?

1083
00:48:44,285 --> 00:48:45,775
Sugar. Two spoons.

1084
00:48:45,853 --> 00:48:47,480
Two spoons.
Thank you.

1085
00:48:47,555 --> 00:48:48,817
Be careful!

1086
00:48:48,889 --> 00:48:53,019
Jam! I forgot
all about jam.

1087
00:48:53,094 --> 00:48:54,083
Mustard!

1088
00:48:54,161 --> 00:48:55,651
Mustard, yes.

1089
00:48:55,763 --> 00:48:57,731
Mustard?

1090
00:48:57,765 --> 00:49:00,063
Don't let'
be silly.

1091
00:49:00,134 --> 00:49:02,261
Lemon.
That' different.

1092
00:49:03,471 --> 00:49:05,405
That should do it.

1093
00:49:05,473 --> 00:49:06,940
[Ring]

1094
00:49:08,242 --> 00:49:09,368
Look at that!

1095
00:49:09,443 --> 00:49:10,501
Goodness.

1096
00:49:10,578 --> 00:49:11,272
Dear.

1097
00:49:13,581 --> 00:49:15,276
Mad watch.

1098
00:49:15,349 --> 00:49:16,611
Mad watch!

1099
00:49:18,552 --> 00:49:22,955
There' only one way
to stop a mad watch.

1100
00:49:23,024 --> 00:49:26,516
Two days slow,
that' what it is.

1101
00:49:26,594 --> 00:49:29,324
Oh, my watch.

1102
00:49:29,397 --> 00:49:30,455
It was?

1103
00:49:30,531 --> 00:49:33,295
It was an
unbirthday present.
